Just to make sure in every 10 hours, they will get at least
1) FREE Accommodation ((length : 250 inches) x (width : 250 inches) x (height : 250 inches), per capita)
2) FREE Bath (150 litres, per capita)
3) FREE Drink (2.5 litres, per capita)
4) FREE Bread (1/4 of a single dinner plate, per capita) 
5) FREE Meat or Fish: depends on available livestock || Vegetables for Vegetarians (1/4 of a single dinner plate, per capita) 
6) FREE Fruits (1/4 of a single dinner plate, per capita) 
7) FREE Rice || Buckwheat or Millet for workers that need to chase their time (1/4 of a single dinner plate, per capita)
8) FREE Toilet Paper (1 roll: 4.5 inches long x 4.5 inches wide, at least 200 sheets per roll, per capita)
9) FREE Soap (1 US fluid ounce or 29.5735 millilitres, per capita)

11) FREE Land Transportation (for those who needs to march and hit ground more than 1,000 paces, per capita)
12) FREE Land, Sea, Air Transportation (for those who needs to move more than 200,000 paces, per capita)
13) 1-hour rest after 10 hours work

* a single dinner plate is at least 13 inches in size <br />
* since animals, livestock like cattle, cow, that needs years to multiply, goat, sheep, that needs half of a single year to multiply, it needs very good management, give it some time to multiply, among the solution is the bird type of meat like chicken also only take a couple of months to multiply, and the water-based animals like fish that usually take weeks to multiply <br />
* 1 cup of wild rice need to cook between 45 to 55 minutes before serving it to workers, some workers may need to chase their time for their other tasks or jobs they need to do in their life, therefore should give them other cereal option that can help with the workers time management <br />
* all foods and drinks must be fresh, properly cooked to prevent any sickness of the workers, to maximize the number of nutrient intakes, the maximum is 24 hours from the kitchen finished product preparation to the table of workers, specialize the route for dining preparation so everything can move smoothly, eliminating any waste of time during the food and drinks prepared for the workers
* drink is at least properly boiled raw water, properly treated hot tea, properly treated hot chocolate
* bread is at least a loaf of baguette, a loaf of brioche, a loaf of fougasse, a loaf of michetta
* fruit is at least one cavendish banana, one watermelon, one pineapple, one papaya, one guava

Every night, before 11 pm, do a daily check-up on the kitchens and bathrooms, make sure everything is working fine, in good order, in a good arrangement, clean and tidy, without any mess. If everything is strange or broken, take some simple notes of it, try to fix it within 24 hours, the clean working environment creates a clean mind for everyone, easy to reach meaning easier access for everyone.

EVERY 2 DAYS
---
Make sure everyone can get at least 8 hours sleep and rest, do a rotation of workers if any of them is not enough of rest. Allocate enough resources for at least 5 substitute workers for one week of work, in any case of emergencies occurs.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply between the current day and previous day, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain.

Spend at most 1 hour of reading some books or reading materials that are related to workers productivity and engineering-related disciplines, try to ask at most 1 question, when finished reading the books in 1 hour, to sharpen my mind, try to solve it within 24 hours, try to discipline myself do not exceed more than 1 hour every 2 days reading the workers productivity and engineering-related knowledge books because time is limited, prioritize the daily, weekly planned works first, finish all the main tasks first, try to read some books or reading materials that are related to workers productivity and engineering-related disciplines in more than 30 minutes to develop a proper chain of thought, the connections that link the various parts of an event or argument together. Duration of reading any books that are related to workers productivity and engineering-related disciplines is between 30 minutes to 60 minutes (1 hour), the main objective of reading the books is always on how to do less while achieving more, how to make life easier for everyone around me and also to myself.

Always remind my self that yesterday is 24 hours, tomorrow must plan at most for 24 hours, today spend 1 hour properly, as every hour in every workers lifetime in the company is so valuable, time is limited, 1 full day, either yesterday or today or tomorrow only consist of at most 24 hours.

EVERY 5 DAYS
---
The workers that already exceed 100 working hours every 5 days, automatically will be given at least 24 hours uninterrupted rest. 

Human workers that did not have enough sleep, enough rest are very risky for the company because they will have :
* anxiety
* unstable mood
* drowsiness
* forgetfulness
* difficulty concentrating
* difficulty staying alert
* cognitive impairments
* decreased performance at work or school
* increased risk of illness or injury

EVERY 7 DAYS
---
At least 24 hours enough sleep and rest every single week, continuously without any interruption or any disturbance, having very strong mental health, in a very good state of mind, at every beginning of the month in the Gregorian calendar.

At least 5 hours break for Friday prayer, starting from 12 pm to 5 pm.

1) FREE Salt (1 US tablespoon equivalent to 14.7868 millilitres, per capita)
2) FREE Citrus (1 citrus of at least  3 centimetres in diameter, per capita)

* There are at least 110 species of citrus on planet Earth to choose from for the workers, to make sure they are always in a good health every weekend to do their daily works. Every week make sure to check their teeth and tongue, give them at least 1 citrus if found anything strange on their teeth and tongue, and give them rest of at least 24 hours, 1 full day off, to give them enough time for health recovery.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain. Plot a simple weekly graph and do simple statistics about it to read what is happening to it.

EVERY FULL MOON
---
Every time I see a full moon appears on the sky, every single worker must receive at least 1 gantang Negeri of rice, which equals to 2.751 kg of rice following the rules in my mother tongue language "ada padi semua kerja jadi, ada beras semua kerja deras", and every leap year on Gregorian Calendar, on every 29 February, which happens only every 4 years on this earth, every century of workers which equals to 10 contubernium with a total of 80 men commanded by a centurion, a total of at least 81 workers, must receive at least a 4-year-old healthy cow following the standard of Etruscan Emilia-Romagna, which means every cow must be a weight of at least 1,000 kg for each century of workers.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain. Gather all the weekly graph, weekly statistics and make a comparison to better understand what is happening with the workers. Call for a general meeting with the workers who already reached the level of the centurion to reorganize the strategy, tactic and plan for all the workers under their command.

*** Every worker that reached the level of the **Centurion**, meaning a commander of 100 men or women, a leader of a **Tribe** will be given at least 25,000 kupang, to ease their work as the leader of his or her company or tribe.

*** Every worker that reached the level of the **Centurion**, successfully managed their own 100 men or women, ask him or her, if he or she is interested in becoming a **Legion** for at least 25 years of service, commanding at least 5,000 men or women under him or her, grant him or her a title of **Lord** if he or she successfully managed 5,000 men or women under him or her, become the main **Legend** of his or her people, his or her tribe, the real master of food and drink supply chain and its flow for his or her people, his or her tribe, then at the end of his or her 25 years of service for the company, that worker will own some piece of land and building under his or her complete control and authority with a special ceremony by the company will be held for him or her, and a special tribute and respect, from at least, all of his or her minimum 5,000 men or women, under his or her command, supervision, within his or her 25 years of service to the company. 

EVERY 5 YEARS
---
Establish at least one school of engineering for the workers who want to become a **Legion** of the company. Fully open for 24-hours per day but after every 7 hours, give 1 hour time for the cleaning and re-arranging service to take place, so everybody can do their works with a clear mind and less interruption from others. Focusing on civil engineering discipline with government administration studies.

The school must consist at least 5,000 students with their working area of at least 2 square meters, so if any pandemic occurs, they still can go to school, at least 50 teachers with their working area following the Australian Army Slow Time that is 70 paces per minute with a 75cm pace, of at least 10,000 steps per day.

The school library following the standard of The House of Commons Library of the lower house of the British Parliament, that can consist at least 30,000 books majoring in history, topography, literature, biography and politics, as well as the official papers of the company, consisting 4 large rooms, every 40 feet by 25 feet and some 20 feet high. Fully open for 24-hours per day but after every 7 hours, give 1 hour time for the cleaning and re-arranging service to take place, so everybody can do their works with a clear mind and less interruption from others. Every room will have their clock system, so it if the cleaning process is on the way the students or the teachers can always move into another place, so the library is always functioning, welcoming all the people from all over the world. The cleaning and re-arranging service on the main entrace will also have their own working hour each day, this is to make sure to fit with everybody schedule, and also will have at least 4 main entrance into the library, by whole, it is always working non-stop for 24 hours every single day, it will act as one of the main brain of the company. The library will also have a secret door access to it, to be use by the Centurions, Legions, Governments created by the company if all the main doors is not functioning well.

The company will build a continuously flowing water system, visible and not visible hydraulic water system to be used by the teachers and the students in the school. Water is the source of life and the main motivation for human beings to stay alive. Water is an important strategic source for all countries of the world without exception and is far-reaching and is now a major cause of many conflicts and political conflicts. There are several international conventions on water, such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Marbol Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and the Ramsar Convention on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Wetlands. To make sure this as a constant reminder, then the main office of the school will have their own ship above the water so they can see clearly what is always happening to the water system of the school built by the company. 

The school of engineering that will be establish by the company in every 10 years is at least 47,504,876.8 centimetres x 47,504,876.8 centimetres x 300 centimetres, or equivalent to 475,048.768 meter x 475,048.768 meter x 3 meter.

The method that will be used in the project is fully open-source so that anyone in this world can contribute, any donation can be done by donating as small as 1¢ cent or 1p penny coin, so everyone in this world can donate and contribute for the school of engineering project, anyone in this world also can enrol in this class free of any charge, fully sponsored by the company, at least for 7 hours in their lifetime before cleaning and re-arranging service takes place in the school of engineering. Those coming from outside of the company, when they made even a single step into the school, then invite them to be the worker of the company. The hiring process must always go on, hire as many workers as possible into the company.

A teacher to students ratio shall not exceed 1 teacher to every 100 students, 1:100 in a single class, to make sure every teacher in that school has a good healthy mind if there is a needs to exceed that ratio, then need to ask the teacher either they can accept more students into their class or not, so they can do their teaching works with a full heart. The school will always remain as a non-profit organization to make sure the education is always accessible to as many people as possible, any profit gain from selling the teachers own hand-writing will be given back to the teacher wrote that book, 100% ownership of their book writing for the students in the company school.

Any students or teachers that already completed 25,000 hours in the company school, invite them to write at least 25,000 words of a thesis to improve the school system and what their suggestion to improve the company way works. Give them at least any single (1) best product produced by the company as gratitude for writing the thesis after completing a degree, at least 25,000 hours in the school.

Although the school will adopt a full open-source method in their teachings and education, all the offices, libraries, roads, any path in the school, the infrastructures in the school are 100% fully owned by the company, same will happen when the Lords from the company finally formed their own government, all the embassies, the roads, the land, infrastructures inside the foreign embassies in that government will be fully owned by other government within a certain time of period, anything happens inside it can only deal with the Rex, Lord and their main people to maintain proper diplomacy with all other governments, other kings, other ministers around the entire universe. As a constant reminder to everyone in that school, then everything that is owned by the company will have its own mark of words and symbol, logo saying that is fully owned, 100% owned by the company, that is visible to normal human eyes, or for at least 2 metres in distance for a human that has visual acuity of perfect “20/20” vision.

From at least 5 schools of engineering established by the company in a duration of 25 years, there must be at least one (1) proper **Lord** will be fully developed, created by the school of engineering setup by the company, to govern and rule any nation in the entire universe. Within 10 schools of engineering established by the company in a duration of 50 years, there must be at least one (1) proper **Rex** will be fully developed, created by the school of engineering setup by the company as `education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today`.

EVERY 25 YEARS

Create own financial, monetary system, unit of measurement to be used by the **Lord**, try to ease their path and the flow to become the **Rex**, commanding at least 500,000 men or women under him or her, to be the real **King** of his or her own **Kin**, for his or her rulership on his or her home state of government in the next 25 years of service. Currently, in the United States of America (USA), a gallon, the US gallon is equivalent to 128 fluid ounces or 3.785 litres (American spelling). But in the United Kingdom (UK), a gallon, an Imperial gallon is equivalent to 160 fluid ounces or 4.546 litres (British spelling). A clear vision, backed by definite plans, gives a tremendous feeling of confidence and personal power. A goal without a plan is just a wish.

A secure, protected family house for the workers that already reached the level of a **Lord** of at least 1,600 square feet on land, per capita, that consists of;
* Fully functioning water hydraulic system to build their own sauna, their own swimming pool, their own efficient sanitation system
* Indoor gym equipment based on their knowledge, their health medical record and performance, their desire to stay healthy
* Personal library that can consist of at least 25 engineering theme books from any discipline in the engineering world of their own choice, so the workers can always try to sharpen their mind and soul, to always stay productive in their lifetime
* At least 1kg of 24 karat gold grade, finest quality raw and solid gold volume, which equals to 5,000.00 ct ( carat (Metric / mass) for every household, after that worker completed the service for the company for more than 25 years, they may use the gold to do the trades with another human being in almost all part of the planet Earth to complete their other needs and desires since it is proven as one of the most stable commodity in the human world for more than thousand of years since the era of Egyptian Pharaohs rule the planet Earth

*** Every worker that reached the level of the **Lord**, successfully managed their own 5,000 men or women, ask him or her, if he or she is interested in becoming a **Government** for at least another 25 years of service, commanding at least 500,000 men or women under him or her, grant him or her a title of **Rex** if he or she successfully managed 500,000 men or women under him or her, become the real **King** of his or her people, his or her own **Kin**, the real master of food and drink supply chain, its flow, and civil engineering knowledge all-rounder know-how of his or her people, his or her own **Kin**, then at the end of his or her another 25 years of service for the company, that worker will own a home state of government under his or her complete control and authority with a special ceremony by the company will be held for him or her, and a special tribute and respect, from at least, all of his or her minimum 500,000 men or women, under his or her command, supervision, within his or her another 25 years of service to the company.

*** Civil engineering is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering, specialized to build proper infrastructures for every civilian of a nation, to ease everyone daily works, better flow of works by applying the engineering knowledge know-how to the infrastructures used by the civilian in their daily life.

EVERY 50 YEARS
---
Send at least 1 **Lord**, those that commanding at least 5,000 men or women under him or her, successfully commanding a Legion to lead any nation in this world, to solve humans main problems in their life especially in food and drinks supply, healthcare system, civil engineering related works, to engineer and develop an efficient system for that nation and also to recruit more workers into the company.

A secure, protected home state of government for the workers that already reached the level of a **Rex** of at least 5,000 square feet on land, per capita, that is suitable for farming and consists of;
* Fully functioning water hydraulic system to build their own sauna, their own swimming pool, their own efficient sanitation system
* Indoor and outdoor gym equipment based on their knowledge, their health medical record and performance, their desire to stay healthy
* A home state library that can consist of at least 1,000 engineering theme books from any discipline in the engineering world of their own choice, so the workers can always try to sharpen their mind and soul, to always stay productive in their lifetime, capable of solving as many problems as they can in this world
* A promise of a full backup, protection, help from other Legions and Tribes of the company, from all over the part of this world to help and assist him or her, anytime he or she is in trouble in his lifetime, that will reach his home state of government within 100 hours or 6,000 minutes, or within 360,000 seconds, by all the means they will come to him or her either by air, by sea, by land, by flying, by swimming, by running, by walking, by crawling
* At least 1 diamond of 25 karat, finest quality unbreakable diamond, for every home state of government of that worker, after that worker completed his or her service for the company for at least more than 50 years, they may use the diamond to do the trades with another human being in almost all part of the planet Earth to complete their other needs and desires since it is treasured by the humans in more than 3,000 years, and it is also the hardest and toughest ever material on planet Earth

EVERY 100 YEARS

Produce a well-crafted hardcover grand book that consists of at least 25,000 words with all the Rex developed by the company, that owned and ruled the governments, kingdoms around the world with at least 500,000 workers in a single Rex rulership around the universe with the master plan set up by the company, gather all the success stories, the challenges it takes to defeat the company main benchmark, the total number of the current biggest employer on planet Earth, United States Department of Defense (DoD, USDOD, or DOD) who is currently managing the United States Armed Forces, almost near to 10,000,000 workers, also holds the current superpower status on planet Earth.
Count all the assets of the company on land, sea, water, space and all company related statistics before writing that grand book of 100 years of company achievements in producing as many Rex as possible to rule the governments, the kingdoms around the world, and also to hire as many workers as possible around the world.
<br /><br />
Minimum : 10,000,000 / 500,000 = 20 Rex / Government / Kingdom
<br /><br />
As a reference, currently, United States Armed Forces under United States Department of Defense (DoD, USDOD, or DOD) owned at least 561,975 facilities on over 4,800 areas, over 25 million acres of land, owned at least 250,000 land vehicles, at least 5,285 aircrafts, at least 293 sea ships and billions of global supply chain for their workers and their international operations around the clock.
<br /><br />
Make sure to make a good introduction, a proper table of contents of that book so it can become a good reference, good guidance for myself and the Rex, and all the governments and kingdoms under the guidance of the company. Try to gather all the obstacles and challenges from the Rex, before writing that grand book celebrating 100 years of the achievements by the company. On every page, on every side of that book, make sure to leave a blank space of at least 1-inch equivalent to 2.54 centimetre, so that everybody who read that book can write down their chain of thought, or leave some brief note about the writings of that book, on every new chapter, leave a full blank space of a single page to ease, clear the reader's mind, taking a new fresh breath, take some brief break, before entering a new chapter of that book.

Explore new planet to recruit more workers into the company. Tell any creature I found on any planet in the universe, "join the workforce, may the force be with you". Bring all the best fruits from planet Earth produced by human workers that the company recruited in planet Earth, so they can first see and taste the final result of the company workforce before deciding to join the company.
<br /><br />
The flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, Angiospermae, or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants. They are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; in other words, a fruiting plant. The term comes from the Greek words angeion ("case" or "casing") and sperma ("seed").
<br /><br />
There are at least 7,500 types of apples all across the world, each is different according to their natives, there are at least 1,600 types of bananas alone. Do farming activities on that planet, so there will always be enough fruits, enough food and drink supply for every human and any living creatures on any planet in the Solar System.

By this time, Masjidil Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem must be fully secured by the company, in all of the workers recruited by the company, there must be at least one worker recruited from the entire universe who knows how to create the perfect route from Masjidil Al-Aqsa into the heaven, the perfect route, the perfect path between planet Earth and the Heaven. Recruit all the angels from Heaven to be the workers in the company. The throne of the company, all the kingdoms and the governments in all of the universe must be in perfect order, in perfect command, in the perfect arrangement by this time, the activities to recruit more workers must go on, there is always a room, a place for every single creature on the universe in the company.
<br /><br />
Always observe properly what the workers recruited by the company are doing during 25 days break for yearly travel and pilgrimage of Israk Mi'raj, to travel with the workers and family members to Masjidil Haram in Mecca and Masjidil Aqsa in Palestine, starting from 22 Rejab to 17 Sha'ban following at-taqwīm al-hijrī calendar, and see towards the sky, either `And when the heaven is split open and becomes rose-coloured like oil (55:37)` is happening or not when the workers finally reached the Masjidil Aqsa land in Jerusalem, then follow the worker who finally opened the way, the route, the path into the Heaven, and when I meet with the angels in the Heaven, recruit all of them, invite all the angels, as many as possible to be the workers and workforce of the company.

Just keep on hiring more workers into the company, keep on creating more opportunities for others, solve as many problems as possible, try to make everything easier for everyone. Tell any creature I found on any planet in the universe, "join the workforce, may the force be with you". Bring all the best fruits from planet Earth produced by human workers and all other creatures that the company recruited in planet Earth and all of the universe for the recruits, so they can first see and taste the final result of the company before deciding to join the company. If someone asks, why you are doing this for 500,000 years? Then tell them the main life philosophy in my own mother tongue language, as long as I am still alive, `hidup kayu berbuah, hidup manusia biar berjasa`.

## 3. Benchmarks.
At least go as big as `Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran`(around 500,000 workers), better as big as `Russian Armed Forces` (around 3,000,000 workers), then try to aim the total number of `The United States Armed Forces`(almost near to 10,000,000 workers).

There are on average about 250 human babies born every minute, more than 130 million in a year on planet Earth. It is estimated a human female can have around 15 to 30 children in a lifetime, taking pregnancy and recovery time into account. Mrs Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia is said to have given birth to 69 children over 27 pregnancies. Augustus II the Strong also known in Saxony as Frederick Augustus I, who was king of 18th century Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania is fathering, a rumoured 370 children, Sultan Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, the second ruler of the Alaouite dynasty, popularly known as "Warrior King" in Morocco, is reported to have had at least 1,171 children, and Genghis Khan, Emperor of the Mongol Empire, notorious for conquering large areas of 13th century Asia, which became the largest contiguous empire in the history of planet Earth, is estimated to have had between 1,000-2,000 human children. Therefore 500 men can reach into 500,000 humans if they want it to happen in their life. On planet Earth right now, usually, the Arab female like to give birth to more than 10 human babies in their lifetime, in the case of Malaysia country, the father of current 8th Malaysia Prime Minister, Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Dato' Haji Muhyiddin bin Haji Muhammad Yassin father, Tuan Guru Haji Muhammad Yassin bin Muhammad, on average, each of his wives gave birth to at least 11 children. Female humans usually having 2 million to 4 million eggs when they were born, therefore a single female human has a minimum 4x chances to produce more than 500,000 humans on planet Earth.

*** Nothing is impossible in the world of engineering, the word engineer (Latin : ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to create, generate, contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness"). If the worker, he or she want to rise to be the **Rex**, to rule his or her kingdom, his or her government, nothing is impossible if he or she believes that he or she can do it in his or her lifetime. <br />

<a name="belonging"></a>
## 5. Sense of Belonging & Belongingness & Belonging.
From a psychological perspective, a **sense of belonging** is a basic human need, with many psychologists discussing this need as being at the level of importance of that as food, water, and shelter. A sense of belonging can be so powerful that it can create both value in life and the ability to learn healthy coping skills when experiencing intensive and painful emotions. The importance of a sense of belonging can be traced back to infancy, where researchers have studied skin-to-skin contact between babies and their parents. What researchers have found is that when this is combined with a strong emotional engagement, a baby's developmental growth and its recognition of self increases significantly.

**Belongingness** is the human emotional need to be an accepted member of a group. Whether it is family, friends, co-workers, a religion, or something else, people tend to have an 'inherent' desire to belong and be an important part of something greater than themselves. This implies a relationship that is greater than simple acquaintance or familiarity. The need to belong is the need to give and receive attention to and from others.

**Belonging** is a strong and inevitable feeling that exists in human nature. To belong or not to belong can occur due to choices of one's self, or the choices of others. Not everyone has the same life and interests, hence not everyone belongs to the same thing or person. Without belonging, one cannot identify themselves as clearly, thus having difficulties communicating with and relating to their surroundings.

Abraham Harold Maslow, an American psychologist who was best known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs, suggested that the need to belong was a major source of human motivation. He thought that it was 1 of 5 human needs in his hierarchy of needs, along with physiological needs, safety, self-esteem, and self-actualization. These needs are arranged on a hierarchy and must be satisfied in order. After physiological and safety needs are met an individual can then work on meeting the need to belong and be loved. According to Abraham Harold Maslow, if the first two needs are not met, then an individual cannot completely love someone else.

The need to belong is especially evident in the workplace. Employees want to fit in at work as much as students want to fit in at school. They seek the approval and acceptance of leaders, bosses, and other employees. Charismatic leaders are especially known to show off organizational citizenship behaviours such as helping and compliance if they feel a sense of belongingness with their workgroup. Researchers found that charisma and belongingness increased cooperative behaviour among employees. Charismatic leaders influence followers by bringing awareness to the collective unit and strengthening the feeling of belonging, and that enhances employees’ compliance.

EVERY FULL MOON REVISION
---
For the workers who already be with the company for at least **pars minuta prima**, already invested first small part of their time in their life with the company, or equivalent to 1 minute or equivalent to ‪60,000‬ milliseconds or equivalent to ‪60,000,000‬ microseconds, but suddenly left the company, maybe for a reason of not feeling a sense of belonging to the company, always value everyone time in their precious lifetime, always remember in my mind in every single of my breath that **punctuality is the politeness of kings**, they will always be part of the family, part of the company. Every time I see a full moon appears on the sky, if they come back to be the workers in the company, there is always a place for them to start over again, they will receive as same as other workers, they must receive at least 1 gantang Negeri of rice, which equals to 2.751 kg of rice following the rules in my mother tongue language "ada padi semua kerja jadi, ada beras semua kerja deras".

EVERY FULL MOON REVISION (AFTER 4 INITIAL YEARS)
---
For the event every leap year on Gregorian Calendar, on every 29 February, which happens only every 4 years on this earth. The workers who are assigned tasks to raise the livestock, especially the cows, will be given 50% share of the ownership of all the calf produced by all the cows (100% owned by the company), so they can feel a sense of belonging to all the cows and calves under their care, to produce more cows and calves for the company in their service to the company.

Normally cows that produced milk for humans often give birth every 400 days or more. They are highly motivated to look for food and forage for 6 to 10 hours a day, grass and concentrates may only provide enough energy for the cows to produce 5,000 litres of milk of production per year. Gestation, the process or period of developing inside the womb between conception and birth, does vary by breed and by sex of the calf, the ranges from 279 to 287 days are normal for the cows that didn't produce milk for humans. For most breeds, 283 days would be common. Cows carrying bull calves, male calves, tend to have a slightly longer gestation compared to cows carrying heifer calves, female calves.

```
Calculation example
---

1 Year = 365 days (according to Gregorian calendar)

First Year : 10 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) 
Second Year : 10 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) 
Third Year : 14 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) + (CHILDREN : 2 males + 2 females)
Fourth Year : 18 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) + (CHILDREN : 4 males + 4 females)

Therefore: 14 cows owned by the company (10 PARENT cows + 4 CHILDREN cows), while another 4 cows (4 CHILDREN cows) fully owned by the workers to create a sense of belonging for their daily works for the company
```

EVERY 25 YEARS REVISION

For the Lords and Rex level of workers, those commanding at least 5,000 men or women under them, for everything they found on land, and sea will be divided equally, 50% will belong to them, while other 50% will belong to the company as a whole to create a sense of belonging to all their works in their territory, their area of interest, except diamonds and platinum group of metals, which they may choose one of the best diamond and platinum metal every single year for them and their men or women under their command, while other diamonds and platinum group of metals found will belong to the company, this is to make all the civil engineering related works easier for everyone, to build proper cities, towns, villages, roads, highways, expressways, bridges, school buildings, to cut the stones, to cut the big trees, to do the mining activities, almost every single civil engineering related works will take a lot longer, longer route, longer path, longer time, more effort if cannot get the best equipment, best tools to do the engineering works.

The name platinum is derived from the Spanish word platina “little silver", the name given to the metal by Spanish settlers in Colombia. The six platinum-group metals are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. They have similar physical and chemical properties, and tend to occur together in the same mineral deposits. However they can be further subdivided into the iridium-group platinum-group elements (IPGEs: Os, Ir, Ru) and the palladium-group platinum-group elements (PPGEs: Rh, Pt, Pd) based on their behaviour in geological systems.

The platinum metals have many useful catalytic properties. They are highly resistant to wear and tarnish, making platinum, in particular, well suited for fine jewellery. Other distinctive properties include resistance to chemical attack, excellent high-temperature characteristics, high mechanical strength, good ductility, and stable electrical properties. Apart from their application in jewellery, platinum metals are also used in anticancer drugs, industries, dentistry, electronics, and vehicle exhaust catalysts (VECs). VECs contain solid platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) and are installed in the exhaust system of vehicles to reduce harmful emissions, such as carbon monoxide (CO), by converting them into less harmful emissions.

Palladium in the platinum-group metals, for example, acts as an excellent catalyst, and helps turn some of the polluting compounds expelled as part of an internal combustion engine into less harmful components. These compounds – such as hydrocarbons and nitrogen – are highly damaging to humans and the environment, and have been subject to strict regulations in recent years.

<a name="unit"></a>
## 6. Unit of measurement.
A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity. Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement. Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.
<br /><br />
The definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of systems of units used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system.
<br /><br />
In trade, weights and measures is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).
<br /><br />
Metrology is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement. In physics and metrology, units are standards for measurement of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. Reproducibility of experimental results is central to the scientific method. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.
<br /><br />
Science, medicine, and engineering often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in problem-solving.

<a name="commodity"></a>
## 7. Commodity.
The word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French commodité, "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin commoditas, meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word commodus (from which English gets other words including commodious and accommodate) meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit". In short, commodity means **_a useful or valuable thing_**.
