## 1. Mission introduction.

Every mission accomplished means every single worker in the mission will receive at least 1 kupang, when the workers managed to ally with other workers, at least 10 workers in a group, and every single worker having at least 10 kupang in their possession then the company will arrange accounting and finance class for every 3 months for at least 3 hours with every single worker will have their specialized comfortable seat or chair and a book to keep track of their financial record and performance for each mission within the company. `Practice makes perfect`, after they attended at least 10 accounting, finance and club management classes arranged by the company, completed all the practices given by the company instructor, then the company will arrange the next stage and level of the financial knowledge for the workers, at least 5 hours bank, investment and asset management class, with their own specialized comfortable seat or chair and a meeting table with a dimension of 200 inches of length x 70 inches of width x 35 inches of height, to ease them writing better table of contents for business proposals, structuring the business law and regulations, presenting their ideas to the group of workers in their alliance. On the next stage, the group of 10 workers will form another alliance with another 5 groups (each group consisting of 10 workers), the total group of worker alliances is 6 to make the counting process easier, manually by using both normal human hands and fingers, by implementing the base 60 system, and also to manage the time as efficient as possible, aiming for better accuracy of directions rather just using left right front back commands, to make sure everyone is well-aligned with at least the person sitting next to him or her, for the purpose to do initial practice on how the financial, banks and investment firms works, to get a clearer bigger picture, crystal clear vision on what they want to achieve in pursue of their own financial freedom in their life before the next board meeting, where everyone in the meeting in the latter stage will hold the director title. A proper building, equipment, logistic operations for workers financial operations based on their own proposals on those meetings can only be guaranteed when the workers, the group of 10 people agreed, made an official statement and agreement to join and become the Legion, a group of at least 5,000 men and women for the company, every 5 years, there will be a major conference to reach the next stage after they agreed to join and become a Legion, to become a government, a workforce, a group of at least 500,000 workers to ease all the financial path for all the workers in the company. A month for the workers that not reached the level of a Legion, still in the training period will be fixed to 30 days a month, every mission will not exceed 60 days to ease the calculation process before the 3 hours accounting and finance class on the third month for better preparation, fully focus to the lesson and instructions from the company instructors. All the financial calculation for the fresh recruited workers will try to use the easiest mathematical method by learning on how to count by using their own hands, for example if using base 10 system, they may need to write down all the numbers when they try to do the fraction operation of 1/3 = 0.333333, but when they are using base 12 system, 1/3 in base 10 system will become 4/10 = 0.4 in base 12, the fraction operations in base 10 system is much easier in base 12 system, historically weight and measure is based on base 12 system, 1 foot contains 12 inches, for the base 60 system, the digit location in base 60 system can hold more value than using base 10 system, for example the 4 digit number 1234 in base 60 system is equivalent to 223,384 in base 10 system, by the end of all the 10 accounting, finance and club management classes arranged by the company, the company workers will have good knowledge and better understanding why the clock is based on base 12 system; 12 hours clock and base 60 system; 60 minutes, 60 seconds, why there are 24 hours in a day, why a complete full circle is 360 degree; from class to class they will have some basic understanding on why `time is money`; and to properly observe the changes they can see clearly high above the sky; the sun and the moon, and some basic understanding of the importance of the stars they see on the sky when they are fully ready to explore more deep about the world of mathematics, computations and calculations. By knowing the basic principle in base 12 system, base 60 system, knowing that the full circle is 360 degree, knowing how to read properly their surroundings especially the changes of the sun and the moon on the sky, knowing better about themself, how to use the proportion of their own perfect human body for mathematical measurement, the digit, for example, to place a value in positional numeral systems is originally based on the breadth of a human finger. It was a fundamental unit of length in the Ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Hebrew, Ancient Greek and Roman systems of measurement. In astronomy, a digit is using the base 12 system where a digit is 1/12 of the diameter of the sun or the moon. When the workers joined and became the Legion, they will be registered into more advance mathematical classes, begin to learn the basics of trigonometry in the school of engineering that will be built by the company for the workers, using triangle rules to measure properly every single thing they see, the height, width, distance, depth of everything they can see and observe with their own bare naked eyes, with greater accuracy, precision and stability, to have a peace of mind in their calculations, computations, from time to time, the company workers will eventually know why the ancient human civilization like in Ancient Egypt built a lot of very huge and gigantic pyramid with a shape of triangle, a lot of very tall obelisk structures, with a very high precision of calculations, how the Romans managed to get the breads, transport the water, properly engineered their logistics operations, basic resources in its own empire, how they made all the basic food and water supply need for human being always enough for all its civilian in its own empire, with the long term aim for the workers recruited to become a well respected, well functioning government workers, leaders and doers with a good basic, well-rounded governance knowledge, proper mathematics, engineering knowledge gained from the school of engineering setup by the company; continuously testing all the truth of the knowledge gained from all the classes arranged by the company to know better about their self, the director of their own self, as `knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom`.

The reason why kupang is selected as the currency for freshly recruited company workers because it is easier to explain on what is the definition of money, the kupang name itself that holds the meaning, the origin and the history of money in human civilization, and also to let as many people involved in the activities, as anything that related to the educational stuff, classroom activities are not profit-based activities in the entry-level but is a very important, critical aspect in developing well educated, knowledgeable, well-rounded workers for the company to accomplish properly any mission in any situation given to them in the future, `education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today`. Alliances will take you further, from the origin of the coin by Alexander The Great who made massive alliances in Akkad, the Arab nations in this world who holds the highest rank, #1, #2, #3, #4 highest value in currencies recognized as legal tender in United Nations (UN), rank as #1, #2, #3, #4, made the Akkad or Akad name as great meaning in their life, عقد, when they made alliances or pacts with other humans on planet Earth. The allied forces who won World War II made the English language as the largest language by the number of speakers, today's major language of trade and industry. If only one man or woman do the job, the work, he or she may gather up to 10 kupang, but with a good mathematical understanding on how the finance system works, how the House of Money or House of Wealth, commonly known as Baitulmal, بيت المال, works, how strategic alliance or strategic partnership works, how to properly manage their current and future assets, how to make good judgment, calculations in very complex logistic operations, how to become a good director who knows how to do proper commands to other people under their care, it is possible for 10 kupang in their current

They will be taught lessons about the thing that is far more important than money under the discipline of economics, the microeconomics and macroeconomics, definitely dealing a lot with various existing governments around the world, around the universe, international trade concept in bartering activities that involves a direct trade for goods and services. Bartering is the process of trading services or goods between two parties without using money in the transaction. When people barter, everyone benefits because they receive items or services they need or want. Bartering also has an advantage because even people without money can get something they need. Bartering might involve trading a service for an item. Nations across the world need trade. There is no country in the world that is totally self sufficient. Some are rich in natural resources but lack the technological advancements to capitalise on these resources to their full potential. Others have great agricultural developments but they do not have defense equipments or artillery. Some have the knowledge and resources but they lack the currency to use the knowledge and resources effectively. In all aspects trade is very important for both developed and developing countries. To do barter, trades with various existing local and foreign governments, nations around the world, they need to know, understand at least the basic concept of logistic operations, and they also need at least a `company` (100 workers, soldiers that are well paid, well trained humans, very strong state of mind), to ensure proper security, mission accomplishment for everyone in the mission, before finally some profit can be made by the company activities around the world, around the universe. Nations across the world today use barter exchange to fulfill their needs. Barter is being effectively used by many nations today instead of national aid. Many countries rich in natural resources like coal and iron are trading them for basic necessities of their people like food. The biggest barter deals in the world are counter trades, often done government to government. Until the day the company officially announced the formation of his own government, a very strong workforce of at least 500,000 workers around the world, around the universe, forming his own kingdom of supreme power, securing all the trade routes, all the trade paths, all the trade secrets in this world, in this universe, then the main idealogy that must always stick repeatedly in everybody mind is work hard!

The United States was suddenly a colonial power with overseas dependencies, the birth of superpower nation finally becomes a dream come true for the Americans; holding the position as the biggest, the most powerful, #1 Navy and Maritime power on planet Earth, this is more understandable to the Dutch people and the people that currently live around the Baltic Sea; Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Russia, Belarus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Norway, Slovakia, Ukraine; the Dutch people are the masters to the Pilgrim Fathers; at a commemorative bicentennial celebration in 1820, orator Daniel Webster used the phrase Pilgrim Fathers, and the term became common usage thereafter; the first permanent colony in New England in year 1620, who had earlier fled to Leiden, the Netherlands, eventually determined to establish a new settlement in The New World also known as The Americas, then the region of their settlement,  currently known as United States of America (USA); during the era that is popularly known as `Dutch Golden Age`, when the Dutch, the people that currently live in the country now known as The Netherlands, ruled the world, in which Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world, the Dutch people called the Baltic Sea as the **mother of all trades**, as the Dutch people considered the Baltic Sea to be the basis of most of their trade and shipping and indeed the cornerstone of the Dutch economy. Sea in English Language, the people in Germany spell it as 'see', the Dutch people spell it as 'zee'. `For whosoever commands the sea commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself.`

Fresh workers training, mentoring, advising ratio : **[1:1]** -> **[1:10]** -> **[1:60]** <br />
Fresh workers training, mentoring, advising duration : **[2 months]** -> **[30 months]** -> **[2 months]** | about 3 years <br />
Benchmarks for fresh workers : after one to one [1:1] company advising session in the first 2 months, during grouping [1:10] level, after the first 6 months study in accounting and finance classes, then they need to do 25 face-to-face interviews that tend to last no less than 30 minutes in every 7 days, per week, to different kind of people with different kind of backgrounds, no less than 750 minutes or 13 hours per week, to gain confidence, ease of breath on their chest and proper choice of words before entering the discipline of economics classes, the microeconomics and macroeconomics disciplines, because economics is not just about the numbers, it is not just about the money. Economics is about making choices. It is about weighing different choices or alternatives. Some of those important choices involve money, but most do not. The economist not only thinking about the value of the money, what a single coin can holds; always remember to bring at least a single coin to the class for easier understanding of basic principle in economics; but also which side of the coin he or she must choose, probability of success due to chance, then the number of actual successes is compared to the chance expectation, implementing the knowledge of `probability and statistics` that function as an important tool to the economist, the branches of mathematics concerned with the laws governing random events, including the collection, analysis, interpretation, and display of numerical data. Always believe your chance will come by saying `I will prepare and some day my chance will come`, as this is what **Abraham Lincoln** said and did, who rise from extreme financial challenges, extremely poor to become the 16th president of the United States of America (USA), currently the sole superpower nation on planet Earth. To better understand on how the economist thinks and works on the current situation, is to observe properly on how **Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron**, the current President of France works, who obtained his master's degree in public affairs from Institut d'études politiques de Paris, Paris Institute of Political Studies, majoring in "Public Guidance and Economy". The basic understanding in the principle of economics is always far superior knowledge than just plain knowledge in accountancy, money to what known to the people who adhere completely in the knowledge of accountancy, especially in the country or state that will not exist anymore on the world map because the war that is happening inside the country or the state, or on the verge of war with its neighbours, so what will happen to the paper money, the coins, the currency, the government promises that the state or country that once holds it when it is completely vanished from the world map, like what happened to Yugoslavia country when finally the country break up into seven countries; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Kosovo; Macedonia; Montenegro; Serbia; Slovenia? Nobody really cares about it anymore,`the winner takes it all, the loser standing small`, only those who got very good understanding in economics, international trades and international relations continue to be a successful person, continue to survive after that. <br />
Training objectives : financial freedom for each individual workers, understand logistics, fit properly with company culture <br />
During emergency cases happen during the training period : every single worker can claim company loans up to £10,000 every 3 years, with 0% of interest rate <br />

Emergency cases financial loans allocation calculation for the company workers : £10,000 x 500,000 workers = £5,000,000,000 for every 3 years = £1,666,666,666.666666667 for every year = £138,888,888.888888889 for every month = £4,629,629.62962963 for every day = £192,901.234567901 for every hour = £3,215.020576132 for every minute = £53.583676269 for every second, every time a worker make a loan, then he or she will automatically become a closely followed subject of study to develop better future company economic policy, the company loan money given is printed with a specialised serial number and act as a legal tender, accepted within the state government where he or she is currently working for the company. As a reminder, money that can act as a legal tender can only be produced by the current existing state governments in this world, therefore honestly, the company also borrow the money from the state government to ease all the workers emergency cases in their tough time, that is why it can only be given as financial loans, because the company need to pay back the money borrowed from the state government, one of the reason why the priority of workers recruitment is to the workers within the same region, state, country government that the company building established, to ease all the financial process with the state government, foreign workers need to wait until the company generate profits in the future so they can also have that kind of privilege, the company can only produce promissory notes for them, it can be use with the company trade partners, will ease some of the trade process but not all kind of trades because it is not a legal tender, only the current existing governments can produce money that is known as a legal tender.

Days, hours off during training period : at least 24 hours every single week to spend his or her time with his or her own family members, a single mission will not exceed 6 months period, therefore every single worker deserve at least 576 hours equivalent to 24 days in a 6 months mission, `a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man`.  

The basic payment for the workers after they completed the 3 years company initial training for the fresh workers will be paid during the "harvest moon", will be on par or above the National Minimum Wage Act defined by the state government where the company and office building located. The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180°). Historically, month names are names of moons (lunations, not necessarily full moons) in lunisolar calendars. Since the introduction of the solar Julian calendar in the Roman Empire, and later the Gregorian calendar worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as "moon" names. The traditional Old English month names were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time. The "harvest moon" is the full moon nearest to the autumnal equinox (22 or 23 September), occurring anytime within two weeks before or after that date. All full moons rise around the time of sunset. Since the Moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the Sun, lunar culmination is delayed by about 50.47 minutes (on average) each day, thus causing moonrise to occur later each day.

Finance education training currency flow structure : **[ 10 kupang / assarius / assarii : 1 deni / penny ]** -> **[ 12 deni / denarius / penny / pence : 1 shilling ]** -> **[ 20 shillings : 1 pound / £ 1 ]** == **[ 240 deni / denarius / penny / pence : 1 pound / £ 1 ]**, if divided equally between 10 workers who originally invested their 10 kupang to be the company workers, then it will represent 24 hours in a full single day, to remind them why `time is money` | using **promissory notes system**; specific promise to pay along with the steps and timeline for repayment as well as consequences if repayment fails, and **legal tender** approved by existing governments, legal tender is declared by law to be valid payment for debts and financial obligations, legal tender is the currency that cannot legally be refused in payment of debt, promissory note is not legal tender although it can be use to ease some business transactions, flow of trades, only existing governments can issue legal tender in this current world, what’s classed as legal tender varies depending on the laws and regulations of the state governments in this world; in England and Wales, it’s Royal Mint coins and Bank of England notes, in Scotland and Northern Ireland it’s only Royal Mint coins and not banknotes, this is why until the company officially become a fully functioning government, then the main idealogy is **WORK HARD!**

Workers recruitment priority : workers within the same region, state, country government that the company building established, to ease all the trade activities in the area, to ease drafting annual rules and regulations that can fit into both company and the existing government, if during the training period of time, the company made any profit, then paying reasonable annual tax to the state government also means to give the company workers maximum protection and security that originally under protection, care of their government, their own trusted people; transparent, ethical business practices will ease the flow to establish stronger company structure and organization; generally all the company workers are under the company protection, without the existing state government support protection, the company workers recruited from other regions, then the company will try to minimize all the risks as best as possible, alerting their embassies inside the existing state government where the company office building established<br /> 

Poor class definition : following the common international poverty line (IPL) historical definition, income less than US$1 per day <br />

Mission duration period : for the first phase, it will take **at least 11 years** <br />
Mission provision period : sustainable, able to survive; do not expect any profit for **at least 5 years** <br />
Mission main principle : never trust, always verify; **Zero Trust = Authentication + Authorization + Encryption** <br />
Mission main idealogy : anything is possible in this world but one thing for sure to accomplish the mission, **WORK HARD !!!** <br />

`Whoever begs, even though he has staple food for one day, is the same as robbing the weak and the poor.` - from the book, Raudhatu ath-Thalibin wa ‘Umdatu as-Salikin also known as Garden of the Truth.

There are more than 50,000 edible plants in the world, but just 15 of them provide 90 percent of the world’s food energy intake. Rice, corn (maize), and wheat make up two-thirds of this. These three are the staples of about 80 percent of the world population, and rice feeds almost half of humanity.  Other food staples include millet and sorghum; tubers such as potatoes, cassava, yams, and taro; and animal products such as meat, fish, and dairy.

13) 1-hour rest after 10 hours work, 4x 15 minutes rest during 10 hours work to prevent burn-out, if the work need to do continuously without rest, then the day before it, 24 hours before it, will do a full medical body check-up and some mental health test to ensure the worker is really fit for the work for the next day, 4x 15 minutes rest is when there is enough workers to do rotation of works, at least 3 workers when applying the `lean manufacturing methodology`, if not enough at least 3 workers, then they need to be smart and calculative to prevent the burden of tasks, injury or even death, success is a mystery but death is certain especially when dealing with every single day 24 hours non-stop high performance running machinery, **engineering** name itself means **ingenious**, in its original language, the Latin language, **ingeniōsus**, also means **genius**; in ancient Roman culture, **genius** is the household spirit that enable the household to do what needed to be done, the genius of the house, manifested in the paterfamilias – the father and head of the family – ideally worked in concert with the Genius Loci – the spirit of the ground on which one’s house was built, **genius** was honored on the birthday of the head of the household and was defined as "a spirit of manhood" with special influence over the marriage bed; that also form the basis word of **engine** in English language that comes from the old French word, **engin**, that originally comes from the Latin word **ingenium**, that also becomes the word **ingenuity** in English language that means `the quality of being clever, original, and inventive`, the knowledge that originally popularised by **Gaius Julius Caesar**, Roman general and statesman who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire, from the death of Gaius Julius Caesar who popularised the original concept **engineering** in Western World, given rise to **Imperator Caesar divi filius Augustus**, Gaius Julius Caesar beloved adopted son, who then founded the word and concept of what now known as **asset**, when he said `marmoream relinquo, quam latericiam accepi` meaning `I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble` after he finally managed to command and conquer the female Pharaoh of Egypt, **Cleopatra VII Philopator**, who believes that she is the real depiction of Goddess Isis; Goddess Isis also known as Eset atau Aset, later popularly known as **asset** in English language, an item of property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies, because **Imperator Caesar divi filius Augustus** is well known for his great wealth of asset and richness in the Western World, and until now, by the official record of accounting and finance knowledge, non of any single human alive on this current world on planet Earth, achieved Agustus status of wealth yet, more than £3 trillion worth of personal wealth by the currency of United Kingdom nowadays. After the Fall of the Roman Republic during the time **Gaius Julius Caesar**, Octavian, later known as Augustus, kept the emblem of SPQR, an abbreviation for Senātus Populusque Rōmānus, the phrase suggests that all power comes from the people of Rome, govern together with the Senātus means `Senate`, meaning well experience people, in Agustus faith and belief, is that govern together with his father, **Gaius Julius Caesar**, to demonstrate continuity with the past, with his father, **Gaius Julius Caesar**, even though Augustus was creating a new Imperial system, to project the Roman Empire as the new superpower nation, and nowaday Emilia-Romagna region in Italy still keeping the **SPQR** emblem, the home of high performance engineering marvels especially in automotive industry, given birth to so many great engineering based companies in current modern world like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Pagani, De Tomaso, Dallara, and Ducati; **ingeniōsus** is a plural form of **genii** in Latin language, same meaning as **genie** in English language or **Jin, الجن** in Arabic language, the Romans believe that they are actually try to command and conquer something that cannot be clearly seen by normal human eyes, the spirit, the ghost that take care of some soul or some of area, this is why the fresh workers will be taught the base 60 system when they first entered the company by only using human hands and fingers, the very basic mathematics by only using human anatomy as the perfect guidance base of concept, to develop good mathematical thinking and awareness in their mind, because every work no matter how hard or how dangerous it is, it needs to be done, that is the main reason why the company is established in the first place. Do not ever fall asleep when doing your job or your work, it is for your safety, if need rest or having any kind of difficulty, without any delay tell others immediately, together we will work on the best solution to make sure everyone is safe while getting all the jobs, all the works done for the company. Success is a mystery but death is certain, `mors certa, hora incerta` meaning that `death is certain, its hour is uncertain`, because of this, every single worker will receive their book, their own `Death Note` before any mission begins to remind them about this, every time you managed to defeat your death, every time you are witnessing that angel of death is coming for you, is in front of you, every time you finally completed your mission, your job, your work, your task that given to you, then write and list all of your accomplishments, challenges as a reference and guide for others in the company, as what now known as `curriculum vitae` often shortened as **CV** or **vita**, in its original Latin language means `course of life` or `course of (one's) life`, you are the one who will define your own life and death, `memento mori, memento vivere`, remember that you will die, remember that you have to live. Stay alive !!! The `curriculum vitae` is for yourself and others who are interested to follow on how you able to survive in your works, your jobs, your missions; for the company you are currently work with, for sure we already know you, the company always keep every record about you but you must remember that there are at least other 499,999 workers in the company to take care of, so make everyone in the company life easier to make better match-making references with the existing company workers records to efficiently assist you in your mission, at least give the company a summary of your `curriculum vitae`, as what now known as `résumé`, what you really want to highlight about yourself based on your `curriculum vitae`, before any mission, any work, any job begin, to make better schedule of works for you, especially for your rest time during the working hours, again remember that `mors certa, hora incerta` meaning that `death is certain, its hour is uncertain`, so prioritize on how you can survive in your `résumé` before any  mission, any work, any job begin, do not exceed more than a single A4 paper when writing a `résumé` as you will need to always carry it, bring it in your mission when you dealing with lots of people to accomplish your mission, it is always a good practice to read at least a good book every single month, so you can get a good idea on how to fit proper words to highlight important things about yourself in a single A4 paper when writing a `résumé`, that will also acts as an aid to introduce yourself to others, when introducing yourself to others, always believe in yourself, don't let the limitations of others limit your vision.  

For every worker who needs to move more than 1 miles, at least more than 5,000 steps, more than 2km or equivalent to 2,000 metres, then in each of their 5,000 steps in their work for the company, they will be given at least 1 pound or equivalent to 0.453592 kilograms or equivalent to 453.5920000001679 gram of sea salt to preserve their food and to fight unwanted bacterial growth, restore hydration, and to absorb dirt, grime, and toxins, cleanses the worker's skin's pores deeply, helps restore the protective barrier in skin and helps it hold hydration, help remove stains and brighten teeth, disinfectant to kill the bacteria that can cause bad breath and gingivitis, softens cuticles and skin and strengthens nail, so the workers can always stay healthy while working for the company. There are at least 12 types of salt used in culinary around the planet Earth, that is safe for human consumption.

* a single dinner plate is at least 13 inches in size <br />
* since animals, livestock like cattle, cow, that needs years to multiply, goat, sheep, that needs half of a single year to multiply, it needs very good management, give it some time to multiply, among the solution is the bird type of meat like chicken also only take a couple of months to multiply, and the water-based animals like fish that usually take weeks to multiply <br />
* 1 cup of wild rice need to cook between 45 to 55 minutes before serving it to workers, some workers may need to chase their time for their other tasks or jobs they need to do in their life, therefore should give them other cereal option that can help with the workers time management <br />
* all foods and drinks must be fresh, properly cooked to prevent any sickness of the workers, to maximize the number of nutrient intakes, the maximum is 24 hours from the kitchen finished product preparation to the table of workers, specialize the route for dining preparation so everything can move smoothly, eliminating any waste of time during the food and drinks prepared for the workers
* drink is at least properly boiled raw water, properly treated hot tea, properly treated hot chocolate
* bread is at least a loaf of baguette, a loaf of brioche, a loaf of fougasse, a loaf of michetta
* fruit is at least one cavendish banana, one watermelon, one pineapple, one papaya, one guava

Every night, before 11 pm, do a daily check-up on the kitchens and bathrooms, make sure everything is working fine, in good order, in a good arrangement, clean and tidy, without any mess. If everything is strange or broken, take some simple notes of it, try to fix it within 24 hours, the clean working environment creates a clean mind for everyone, easy to reach meaning easier access for everyone.

Spend at most 1 hours, every 12 hours to communicate with the workers, at least for 30 minutes to generate better train of thought, be discipline, do not exceed 1 hour conversation with the workers every 8 hours to avoid biased opinions, try to understand more about workers behaviours. Design at least a solution, better workflow for the workers within 24 hours after each conversation. Eliminate anything that does not add value to the workers, work systematically and continuously to create more value for the workers. Define, visualize, optimize, and manage the entire organizational value stream as one value-generating system. Make decisions that optimize the entire organization’s ability to deliver value to the workers, not just one team or department.


EVERY 2 DAYS
---
Make sure everyone can get at least 8 hours sleep and rest, do a rotation of workers if any of them is not enough of rest. Allocate enough resources for at least 5 substitute workers for one week of work, in any case of emergencies occurs.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply between the current day and previous day, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain.

Spend at most 1 hour of reading some books or reading materials that are related to workers productivity and engineering-related disciplines, try to ask at most 1 question, when finished reading the books in 1 hour, to sharpen my mind, try to solve it within 24 hours, try to discipline myself do not exceed more than 1 hour every 2 days reading the workers productivity and engineering-related knowledge books because time is limited, prioritize the daily, weekly planned works first, finish all the main tasks first, try to read some books or reading materials that are related to workers productivity and engineering-related disciplines in more than 30 minutes to develop a proper chain of thought, the connections that link the various parts of an event or argument together. Duration of reading any books that are related to workers productivity and engineering-related disciplines is between 30 minutes to 60 minutes (1 hour), the main objective of reading the books is always on how to do less while achieving more, how to make life easier for everyone around me and also to myself.

Always remind my self that yesterday is 24 hours, tomorrow must plan at most for 24 hours, today spend 1 hour properly, as every hour in every workers lifetime in the company is so valuable, time is limited, 1 full day, either yesterday or today or tomorrow only consist of at most 24 hours.

EVERY 5 DAYS
---
The workers that already exceed 100 working hours every 5 days, automatically will be given at least 24 hours uninterrupted rest. 

Human workers that did not have enough sleep, enough rest are very risky for the company because they will have :
* anxiety
* unstable mood
* drowsiness
* forgetfulness
* difficulty concentrating
* difficulty staying alert
* cognitive impairments
* decreased performance at work or school
* increased risk of illness or injury

EVERY 7 DAYS

1) FREE Salt (1 US tablespoon equivalent to 14.7868 millilitres, per capita)
2) FREE Citrus (1 citrus of at least  3 centimetres in diameter, per capita)

* There are at least 110 species of citrus on planet Earth to choose from for the workers, to make sure they are always in a good health every weekend to do their daily works. Every week make sure to check their teeth and tongue, give them at least 1 citrus if found anything strange on their teeth and tongue, and give them rest of at least 24 hours, 1 full day off, to give them enough time for health recovery.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain. Plot a simple weekly graph and do simple statistics about it to read what is happening to it.

EVERY FULL MOON
---
Every time I see a full moon appears on the sky, every single worker must receive at least 1 gantang Negeri of rice, which equals to 2.751 kg of rice following the rules in my mother tongue language "ada padi semua kerja jadi, ada beras semua kerja deras", and every leap year on Gregorian Calendar, on every 29 February, which happens only every 4 years on this earth, every century of workers which equals to 10 contubernium with a total of 80 men commanded by a centurion, a total of at least 81 workers, must receive at least a 4-year-old healthy cow following the standard of Etruscan Emilia-Romagna, which means every cow must be a weight of at least 1,000 kg for each century of workers.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain. Gather all the weekly graph, weekly statistics and make a comparison to better understand what is happening with the workers. Call for a general meeting with the workers who already reached the level of the centurion to reorganize the strategy, tactic and plan for all the workers under their command.

Try to gather every kind of intelligence from the chefs and the working condition of the kitchen, allocate some portion of company profit to upgrade the kitchen equipment, to send the chef to various kind of countries and cultures in the universe, at least 1 other country or different kind of culture, so they can upgrade their skill and be more creative with their style of cooking, also prepare a special schedule for them, at least one week or more than 150 hours in every 3 months for them to spend more time with various kind of workers in the company, to better understand behaviours of the workers in the company, to always fit with the interest of the workers in the company, to develop more happiness between the workers, chefs, their food and their drinks. 

Chef is the star of the company, so it can attract more workers into the company. The chef cook is the person, who organizes all the work in the company kitchen, and he or she is also the link between the owner of the company and the rest of the workers. A chef cook can be compared to the orchestra conductor, and this means that the success of the company is highly depends on him or her. 

One of the most important qualities a good chef has is building intelligence, that requires cleverness in math. Smart chefs know how to save ingredients and to make most profit of them. They can quickly calculate food costs even without given the information needed, because they are able to control the size of the portion, which leads to accurate menu engineering. For instance, chefs can use equations in order to estimate how many crèmes brûlées can be made with 27 egg yolks. Even when chefs decide to think outside the box and do not precisely stick to the original recipe, math is useful to ensure the right proportions are maintained. Math can be advantageous when converting measurements (ounces to grams, cups to milliliters etc.) In such way, the ingredients are not wasted and the money is saved, can be used for during the emergency situation.

Chefs also have the responsibilities of planning menus, help and supervise the preparation of dishes as well as developing recipes. The chefs order supplies and receive them in the kitchen. It is also a duty of the chefs to maintain cleanliness in the kitchen.

EVERY 12 MONTHS

Develop internal technology roadmap software to make knowledge transfer easier within the company, gathering expert insight to display, document, making a diagram that illustrates the technology and tools used by the company. Technology roadmaps are created to help business leaders plan and strategize which, when, and why certain technologies will be onboarded while avoiding expensive mistakes and even planning for technologies becoming obsolete.

An effective technology roadmap should also outline a strategy to reach short- and long-term digital transformation goals, if applicable. A technology roadmap illustrates the technology presently available and emphasizes scheduled improvements. A technology roadmap should also consider which technologies will become obsolete or are scheduled for the end of life. For example, a work management software system will show when the previous system will sunset and when the new one will be implemented.

When developing the internal technology roadmap, be clear, realistic, easy to share among all the members in the company. All the internal software used within the company must have a lifespan of continuous support at least for 3 continuous years.

Establish at least one school of engineering for the workers who want to become a **Legion** of the company. Fully open for 24-hours per day but after every 7 hours, give 1 hour time for the cleaning and re-arranging service to take place, so everybody can do their works with a clear mind and less interruption from others. Focusing on civil engineering discipline with government administration studies. The word "engineering" itself originally referring about home or house, civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways, focusing on building a complete house or home system. Originally, the word "engineering" comes from the word "engine", the one who masters engineering in Ancient Roman Empire, in the Latin language, was called "ingeniosus", that means superior in intellect, gifted with genius; intellectual, clever, ingenious, the "ingeniosus" equivalent words are still used in the English language nowadays, "ingenious" and also in the Spanish language, "ingeniosa", in Ancient Roman Empire, the word "genius" referred to the spirit of a male Roman who finally successfully built his family home or house, he, the living male in a household is called "paterfamilias" meaning "father of the family" or the "owner of the family estate". In Roman family law, the term "patria potestas" meaning “power of a father” referred to the "paterfamilias", the power that the male head of a family exercised over his children and his more remote descendants in the male line, whatever their age, as well as over those brought into the family by adoption. This power meant originally not only that he had control over the persons of his children, amounting even to a right to inflict capital punishment, but that he alone had any rights in private law. Thus, acquisitions of a child became the property of the father. The father might allow a child certain property to treat as his own, but in the eye of the law, it continued to belong to the father, wherever the Roman soldiers went, on this world, they will bring along what they called "parentes" (pronounced pah-rent-ays) defined as the spirits of one's ancestors but were also those of one’s immediate family - a mother or father - who had passed on but were also the spirits of one's living family. In the popular film Gladiator (2000 CE), the statuettes Maximus Decimus Meridius;a character played by New Zealand-Australia actor, Russell Ira Crowe; a Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus, a Roman emperor who shown a dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a god-like personality cult, with him performing as a gladiator in the Colosseum; prays to of his wife and son would be "parentes" and the "blessed father" he invokes in his prayers would be his father, the "blessed mother" his mother, not a deity like Jupiter or Juno. The "parentes" is associated with the Etruscan word lar, lars, or larth, meaning "lord", anyone who died became a mane, the Manes (pronounced Mah-nays) were the collective dead (di manes = the divine dead) who inhabited the afterlife; then were specified as a lare or a parentes by their family, the "parentes" word in Roman Latin language later known as "parent" in the English language. The spirit called "genius" which later now become the basis of the words like engineering, engineer and engine was also thought to enable the head of the household to do what needed to be done.

The school must consist at least 5,000 students with their working area of at least 2 square meters, continuous flow of fresh air so if any pandemic occurs, if there is still a need to hold the class by the teachers, at least already tried to minimize the risk when everyone is in the school, at least 50 teachers with their working area following the Australian Army Slow Time that is 70 paces per minute with a 75cm pace, of at least 10,000 steps per day. To get continuous fresh air, the school will be built in the middle of a newly explored jungle, newly explored virgin territory, between at least 4 hills, where the fresh air from those hills where in the middle of it will be built the school of engineering by the company, will first be tested using according to the prophet Ibrahim / Abraham / Avraham / Abram divine method mentioned in `2:260`, each of the hills is at least 1,000 feet or equivalent to 304.8 meters above sea level. Before building the school, send the workers that will become the mason, builder of the school to Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Kuwait, hire as many people from those countries to become the workers for the company, study, analyze all the hills and mountains, and all properties and attributes of the hills and mountains from those countries especially in Ancient Civilization of Mesopotamia area, the land in the middle, between rivers, the area of at least 15,000-square-kilometre, to properly apply the prophet Ibrahim / Abraham / Avraham / Abram divine method mentioned in `2:260` to build the school of engineering for the company. If can't find any 4 natural mountains to build the school in the middle of it within 5 years then try to build man-made 4 towers on each side of the area selected, with the height of at least 475,048.768 metres, that will have a height of at least as same as Q1 Tower, Queensland Number One in Australia, that is 322.5-metre or equivalent to 1,058 feet in height to test the air quality of the surrounding area, for at least 1 full month, at least 30 days, before deciding to build the main school building in the middle of the 4 towers, to minimize any health risk factors for the people inside the school area. 

Particulate pollution is observed around the globe in varying sizes and compositions and is the focus of many epidemiological studies. Particulate matter (PM) is generally classified into two main size categories: PM10 and PM2.5. PM10, also known as coarse particulate matter, consists of particles 10 micrometers (μm) and smaller, while PM2.5, also called fine particulate matter, consists of particles 2.5 μm and smaller. PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. It affects more people than any other pollutant. While particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less, (≤ PM10) can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs, the even more health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, (≤ PM2.5). PM2.5 can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer. Particles 2.5 μm or smaller in size are especially notable as they can be inhaled into the lower respiratory system, and with enough exposure, absorbed into the bloodstream. The air quality measurement for every 4 hills or 4 towers on each side of the school building for PM2.5 must be below than 25 μg/m3 within 24-hour mean, measurement for PM10 must be below than 50 μg/m3 within 24-hour mean, routine air quality measurements typically describe such PM concentrations in terms of micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3). When sufficiently sensitive measurement tools are available, concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5 or smaller), are also reported.

The school library following the standard of The House of Commons Library of the lower house of the British Parliament, that can consist at least 30,000 books majoring in history, topography, literature, biography and politics, as well as the official papers of the company, consisting 4 large rooms, every 40 feet by 25 feet and some 20 feet high. Fully open for 24-hours per day but after every 7 hours, give 1 hour time for the cleaning and re-arranging service to take place, so everybody can do their works with a clear mind and less interruption from others. Every room will have their clock system, so it if the cleaning process is on the way the students or the teachers can always move into another place, so the library is always functioning, welcoming all the people from all over the world. The cleaning and re-arranging service on the main entrace will also have their own working hour each day, this is to make sure to fit with everybody schedule, and also will have at least 4 main entrance into the library, by whole, it is always working non-stop for 24 hours every single day, it will act as one of the main brain of the company. The library will also have a secret door access to it, to be use by the Centurions, Legions, Governments created by the company if all the main doors is not functioning well.

The company will build a continuously flowing water system, visible and not visible hydraulic water system to be used by the teachers and the students in the school. Water is the source of life and the main motivation for human beings to stay alive. Water is an important strategic source for all countries of the world without exception and is far-reaching and is now a major cause of many conflicts and political conflicts. There are several international conventions on water, such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Marbol Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and the Ramsar Convention on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Wetlands. To make sure this as a constant reminder, then the main office of the school will have their own ship above the water so they can see clearly what is always happening to the water system of the school built by the company. 

The school of engineering that will be establish by the company in every 10 years is at least 47,504,876.8 centimetres x 47,504,876.8 centimetres x 300 centimetres, or equivalent to 475,048.768 meter x 475,048.768 meter x 3 meter.

The method that will be used in the project is fully open-source so that anyone in this world can contribute, any donation can be done by donating as small as 1¢ cent or 1p penny coin, so everyone in this world can donate and contribute for the school of engineering project, anyone in this world also can enrol in this class free of any charge, fully sponsored by the company, at least for 7 hours in their lifetime before cleaning and re-arranging service takes place in the school of engineering. Those coming from outside of the company, when they made even a single step into the school, then invite them to be the worker of the company. The hiring process must always go on, hire as many workers as possible into the company.

A teacher to students ratio shall not exceed 1 teacher to every 100 students, 1:100 in a single class, to make sure every teacher in that school has a good healthy mind if there is a needs to exceed that ratio, then need to ask the teacher either they can accept more students into their class or not, so they can do their teaching works with a full heart. The school will always remain as a non-profit organization to make sure the education is always accessible to as many people as possible, any profit gain from selling the teachers own hand-writing will be given back to the teacher wrote that book, 100% ownership of their book writing for the students in the company school.

Any students or teachers that already completed 25,000 hours in the company school, invite them to write at least 25,000 words of a thesis to improve the school system and what their suggestion to improve the company way works. Give them at least any single (1) best product produced by the company as gratitude for writing the thesis after completing a degree, at least 25,000 hours in the school.

Although the school will adopt a full open-source method in their teachings and education, all the offices, libraries, roads, any path in the school, the infrastructures in the school are 100% fully owned by the company, same will happen when the Lords from the company finally formed their own government, all the embassies, the roads, the land, infrastructures inside the foreign embassies in that government will be fully owned by other government within a certain time of period, anything happens inside it can only deal with the Rex, Lord and their main people to maintain proper diplomacy with all other governments, other kings, other ministers around the entire universe. As a constant reminder to everyone in that school, then everything that is owned by the company will have its own mark of words and symbol, logo saying that is fully owned, 100% owned by the company, that is visible to normal human eyes, or for at least 2 metres in distance for a human that has visual acuity of perfect “20/20” vision.

From at least 5 schools of engineering established by the company in 25 years, there must be at least one (1) proper **Lord** will be fully developed, created by the school of engineering set up by the company, to govern and rule any nation in the entire universe. Within 10 schools of engineering established by the company in 50 years, there must be at least one (1) proper **Rex** will be fully developed, created by the school of engineering set up by the company as `education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today`.

Devise at least 1 invention that is useful for workers with disabilities. A disability is any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or interact with the world around them. These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime. Hire all people from all background including people with disabilities into the company.

Not everyone in this world was born in 'Perfect 10' condition, the first human achieved the 'Perfect 10' score in gymnastics is a female human being, Věra Čáslavská from Czechoslovakia, today is known as Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ukraine, gained the title 'the love of Tokyo' after winning the overall title and taking gold medals in the balance beam and the vault, in addition to another silver medal in the team event during 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Currently, a human in Tokyo, Japan, Nakamatsu Yoshirō, also known as Dr. NakaMats  holds the most world record for a number of over 3,200 "inventions" in the world of engineering. If you can't do all the gymnastics 'Perfect 10' moves that you see in your lifetime, then at least try to invent any stuff, any tool, any machine, anything, that is useful for others that are not able to do all kind of 'Perfect 10' moves in Olympic Games, the people with disabilities, try to make other people life easier. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook is one of human being born with disabilities, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg then founded Facebook with the help of his family members especially with his beloved sister, Randi Jayne Zuckerberg that has a unique speciality in marketing and advertising. In late 2004, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg asked his sister, Randi Jayne Zuckerberg to join him at his startup Facebook, which he said was understaffed with people willing to travel and who could explain his vision, then Randi Jayne Zuckerberg becomes the director of market development and spokesperson for Facebook to help his beloved colour-blind brother Mark Elliot Zuckerberg set up his own business and become successful in his life. According to The New Yorker, Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colourblind, which means the colour he can see best is blue. That also happens to be the colour that dominates the Facebook website and mobile app. "Blue is the richest colour for me," Mark Elliot Zuckerberg told the magazine. In a duration of 15 years, this brother and sister co-operation of Zuckerberg family members attracted from 0 to at least 2.3 billion users on planet Earth. Right now, human being on planet Earth, especially in Indonesia and Nigeria, when asked "what is the Internet?", most of them will answer, "Facebook", always believe that helping human born with disabilities will outcome a good result, everybody, everyone is special, born with a reason in their own way.

Build at least 1 supercomputer that capable of at least over 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations, calculations per second to hire as many workers as possible into the company from all over the universe. A supercomputer is a group of computers that act as one collective machine, and it’s used to process enormous amounts of data.

With that extreme speed comes extreme heat. Supercomputers can consume as much power as a small city. Studies show that data centres in the United States of America consume 2 per cent of the country’s total energy consumption, one of the reasons why United States of America (USA) places their specialized supercomputer project under Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) with the direct involvement of The United States Department of Energy (DOE) to form a strategic partnership with their sponsoring agencies to ensure that the highest levels of objectivity and technical excellence are applied to the research and development they conduct on behalf of the US government. Much of that energy is used to run chiller units and fans to cool computing hardware. Without an efficient cooling system, the monster machine supercomputers housed in data centres cannot operate properly. When it comes to supercomputers, it’s not all about raw horsepower. Keeping a lid on energy consumption has become one of the biggest technical challenges for making beefier and faster supercomputers. When a computer operates, the central processing unit (CPU) generates heat; the more the processor is strained, the more heat it will produce. If a CPU gets hot enough, it can cause a computer to crash or shut down unexpectedly. The exact shutdown temperature will vary based on the BIOS settings but generally ranges from 70 to 100 degrees Celsius, the purpose of setting a shut-down point for CPU heat is to prevent damage to the Central Processing Unit (CPU).

Many data centers use water to remove waste heat from servers. The warmed water is piped to cooling towers, where a separate stream of water is turned to mist and evaporates into the atmosphere. Like sweat evaporating from the body, the process removes heat from the piped water, which returns to chill the installation. But large-scale replenishment of the evaporated water is needed to continue the process. Thus, an increasing amount of water will be needed worldwide to evaporate heat from the growing number of data centers, which themselves are increasing in size as more users put information into the cloud. Work on water cooling has been going on for years but in a typical data center or supercomputer, the temperatures of servers and other equipment are controlled by passing cool air over racks. Cooling represents roughly half of the energy consumption from these large computing centers.

On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of approximately 3.5%, or 35 parts per thousand. This means that for every 1 litre (1000 mL) of seawater there are 35 grams of salts (mostly, but not entirely, sodium chloride) dissolved in it. Ocean water, with an average salinity of 35 psu (practical salinity unit), ocean salinity is generally defined as the salt concentration (e.g., Sodium and Chlorure) in seawater is measured in the unit of PSU (Practical Salinity Unit), which is a unit based on the properties of seawater conductivity. It is equivalent to per thousand or (o/00) or to g/kg., freezes at -1.94 degrees Celsius (28.5 degrees Fahrenheit). That means at high latitudes, sea ice can form. The average temperature of the ocean surface waters is about 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 90 % of the total volume of the ocean is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. The deep ocean is not well mixed. The deep ocean is made up of horizontal layers of equal density. Much of this deep ocean water is between 0-3 degrees Celsius (32-37.5 degrees Fahrenheit). In the open ocean, the thermocline is characterized by a negative sound speed gradient, making the thermocline important in submarine warfare because it can reflect active sonar and other acoustic signals. This stems from a discontinuity in the acoustic impedance of water created by the sudden change in density. Less dense water floats on top of more dense water. Given two layers of water with the same salinity, the warmer water will float on top of the colder water. The temperature has a greater effect on the density of water than salinity does. So a layer of water with higher salinity can float on top of the water with lower salinity if the layer with higher salinity is quite a bit warmer than the lower salinity layer. One of the solution to keep the supercomputer that can exceed at least 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations, calculations per second, is to build the computer system, placing it under at least 7km or at least 7,000 metres, under the water that has the same properties of normal planet Earth seawater, to reach near 0 degree Celcius, in case of any other cooling system built for that supercomputer fails to function, the whole computer system built by the company can still keep on running, always available to perform its main job to assist the company and the current company workers to hire as many workers as possible into the company.

For supercomputer project with an efficient cooling system, to house the company supercomputer into a specialized building, while trying to be as energy-efficient as possible, there is a need to maximize the knowledge and experience gained from the company workers, raised and developed from the company school of engineering. For the third semester, the next 6 months in school, the students will be taught all the basic civil engineering related knowledge, especially on the concrete strength, assisting the school Chef to learn about the correct mixture of their food and drinks and while serving other students, other company workers under their care, as to operate concrete mixers correctly is one of the biggest safety issues in construction zones. Workers whose tasks are related to concrete processing currently number more than 250,000. Over 10 per cent of those workers, 28,000, experienced a job-related injury or illness, and 42 died in just one year, then for the next 6 month, they will be sent into any civil construction site under company self-managed projects or into the company affiliates, business partners projects around the entire universe to gain as much knowledge as possible about civil engineering. Currently, there are at least 26 types of concrete, the ultimate strength and other properties of concrete depend on several of factors, like the nature of the aggregate materials used, the quality and proportions of cement, water used for making the mixture and the workmanship. The seawater normally decreases the stability of concrete properties. The constituents of seawater react chemically with constituents of cement concrete which results in damage to the concrete structure in several ways. The magnesium sulfate present in seawater reacts with calcium hydroxide of cement and forms calcium sulfate as well as magnesium hydroxide precipitation. Magnesium sulfate also reacts with hydrated calcium aluminate and forms calcium sulpho aluminate. These final formations are the primary reasons for the chemical attack on concrete structures. Sulfates attack the concrete and cause expansion but due to the presence of chlorides in seawater, the swelling of concrete retards. Hence, erosion and loss of concrete take place without showing much expansion. Concrete is not 100% impervious. When seawater enters into the pores of the concrete and reaches the reinforcement then corrosion will occur. It will affect the durability of the structure. Another case is that concrete damaged by abrasion. Seawater may carry sand and silt especially at the shallow end of the sea. When it forcibly contacts the concrete surface abrasion occurs. Abrasion also occurs due to mechanical force buy wave action. If the concrete structure is built in seawater, then the most affected area of the structure is well above the high water mark. The area between low water level and the high water level is less affected while the area which is continuously submerged under the seawater is least affected. The reason behind this is, when the seawater forcibly contacts the area above the high water mark due to wave action, some salty water gets deposited in the concrete pores. When this area dried the water will be crystallized into salt particles and disruption of the concrete takes place. Similarly, when the water in concrete pores is allowed to freeze in cold climates, the concrete will expand and lost its durability.

Produce a well-crafted hardcover grand book that consists of at least 25,000 words with all the Rex developed by the company, that owned and ruled the governments, kingdoms around the world with at least 500,000 workers in a single Rex rulership around the universe with the master plan set up by the company, gather all the success stories, the challenges it takes to defeat the company main benchmark, the total number of the current biggest employer on planet Earth, United States Department of Defense (DoD, USDOD, or DOD) who is currently managing the United States Armed Forces, almost near to 10,000,000 workers, also holds the current superpower status on planet Earth.
Count all the assets of the company on land, sea, water, space and all company related statistics before writing that grand book of 100 years of company achievements in producing as many Rex as possible to rule the governments, the kingdoms around the world, and also to hire as many workers as possible around the world.
<br /><br />
Minimum : 10,000,000 / 500,000 = 20 Rex / Government / Kingdom
<br /><br />
As a reference, currently, United States Armed Forces under United States Department of Defense (DoD, USDOD, or DOD) owned at least 561,975 facilities on over 4,800 areas, over 25 million acres of land, owned at least 250,000 land vehicles, at least 5,285 aircrafts, at least 293 sea ships and billions of global supply chain for their workers and their international operations around the clock.
<br /><br />
Make sure to make a good introduction, a proper table of contents of that book so it can become a good reference, good guidance for myself and the Rex, and all the governments and kingdoms under the guidance of the company. Try to gather all the obstacles and challenges from the Rex, before writing that grand book celebrating 100 years of the achievements by the company. On every page, on every side of that book, make sure to leave a blank space of at least 1-inch equivalent to 2.54 centimetre, so that everybody who read that book can write down their chain of thought, or leave some brief note about the writings of that book, on every new chapter, leave a full blank space of a single page to ease, clear the reader's mind, taking a new fresh breath, take some brief break, before entering a new chapter of that book.

The flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, Angiospermae, or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants. They are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; in other words, a fruiting plant. The term comes from the Greek words angeion ("case" or "casing") and sperma ("seed").

There are at least 7,500 types of apples all across the world, each is different according to their natives, there are at least 1,600 types of bananas alone. Do farming activities on that planet, so there will always be enough fruits, enough food and drink supply for every human and any living creatures on any planet in the Solar System.

By this time, Masjidil Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem must be fully secured by the company, in all of the workers recruited by the company, there must be at least one worker recruited from the entire universe who knows how to create the perfect route from Masjidil Al-Aqsa into the heaven, the perfect route, the perfect path between planet Earth and the Heaven. Recruit all the angels from Heaven to be the workers in the company. The throne of the company, all the kingdoms and the governments in all of the universe must be in perfect order, in perfect command, in the perfect arrangement by this time, the activities to recruit more workers must go on, there is always a room, a place for every single creature on the universe in the company.
<br /><br />
Always observe properly what the workers recruited by the company are doing during 25 days break for yearly travel and pilgrimage of Israk Mi'raj, to travel with the workers and family members to Masjidil Haram in Mecca and Masjidil Aqsa in Palestine, starting from 22 Rejab to 17 Sha'ban following at-taqwīm al-hijrī calendar, and see towards the sky, either `And when the heaven is split open and becomes rose-coloured like oil (55:37)` is happening or not when the workers finally reached the Masjidil Aqsa land in Jerusalem, then follow the worker who finally opened the way, the route, the path into the Heaven, and when I meet with the angels in the Heaven, recruit all of them, invite all the angels, as many as possible to be the workers and workforce of the company.
<br /><br />
*** There is always a room for improvement for every human being, they just need a good education and the time of their own to be a better person, everything begins inside the inner working of human minds, what he or she does will define him or her in the future.

Just keep on hiring more workers into the company, keep on creating more opportunities for others, solve as many problems as possible, try to make everything easier for everyone. Tell any creature I found on any planet in the universe, "join the workforce, may the force be with you". Bring all the best fruits from planet Earth produced by human workers and all other creatures that the company recruited in planet Earth and all of the universe for the recruits, so they can first see and taste the final result of the company before deciding to join the company. If someone asks, why you are doing this for 500,000 years? Then tell them the main life philosophy in my own mother tongue language, as long as I am still alive, `hidup kayu berbuah, hidup manusia biar berjasa`.

## 4. Benchmarks.
At least go as big as `Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran`(around 500,000 workers), better as big as `Russian Armed Forces` (around 3,000,000 workers), then try to aim the total number of `The United States Armed Forces`(almost near to 10,000,000 workers).

There are on average about 250 human babies born every minute, more than 130 million in a year on planet Earth. It is estimated a human female can have around 15 to 30 children in a lifetime, taking pregnancy and recovery time into account. Mrs Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia is said to have given birth to 69 children over 27 pregnancies. Augustus II the Strong also known in Saxony as Frederick Augustus I, who was king of 18th century Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania is fathering, a rumoured 370 children, Sultan Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, the second ruler of the Alaouite dynasty, popularly known as "Warrior King" in Morocco, is reported to have had at least 1,171 children, and Genghis Khan, Emperor of the Mongol Empire, notorious for conquering large areas of 13th century Asia, which became the largest contiguous empire in the history of planet Earth, is estimated to have had between 1,000-2,000 human children. Therefore 500 men can reach into 500,000 humans if they want it to happen in their life. On planet Earth right now, usually, the Arab female like to give birth to more than 10 human babies in their lifetime, even when Arab people go to the other country, to any part on planet Earth, they want to give birth as many humans as possible like what happened to Nadya Suleman of Arab descendant in the United States of America (USA) who gave birth to 6 boys and 2 girls at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center on 26 January 2009, known as Octomom in the American media, currently have at least 14 children right now. In Arab, Russian, Slavic nations tradition, a family that consists of more than 10 children in their house is a normal thing to them. In Gaza, Palestine, almost every single of female Arab there is giving birth to at least 4 children. In the case of Malaysia country, the father of current 8th Malaysia Prime Minister, Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Dato' Haji Muhyiddin bin Haji Muhammad Yassin father, Tuan Guru Haji Muhammad Yassin bin Muhammad, on average, each of his wives gave birth to at least 11 children. Female humans usually having 2 million (2,000,000) to 4 million (4,000,000) eggs when they were born, therefore a single female human has a minimum 4x chances to produce more than 500,000 humans on planet Earth. As a comparison, Chinook, or King Salmon that symbolizes abundance, fertility, prosperity and renewal for thousands of years in America, an extremely important animal to both the lifestyle and the spirituality of many Native American cultures, the lifeblood of the people who call the Pacific Northwest home, even define themselves as Salmon People, can only lay an average of 5,400 eggs.

*** Nothing is impossible in the world of engineering, the word engineer (Latin : ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to create, generate, contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness"). If the worker, he or she want to rise to be the **Rex**, to rule his or her kingdom, his or her government, nothing is impossible if he or she believes that he or she can do it in his or her lifetime. <br />

*** If within a year, no one can recruit more than 100 workers to be in his or her group of workers, and there are enough 100 workers inside the company, then there will be an election to elect the leader in the level of Centurion, candidacy will be based on his or her performance, mission accomplishment drafted on the cumulative frequency chart, so every worker in the company can make better decision to choose their leader to lead them for tasks and missions on the following year during their service to the company.

*** If within 25 years, no one can recruit more than 5,000 workers to be in his or her group of workers to achieve the level of Legion, and there are enough 5,000 workers inside the company, then there will be an election to elect the leader in the level of Lord, candidacy will be based on his or her performance, mission accomplishment drafted on the cumulative frequency chart, so every worker in the company can make better decision to choose their leader to lead them for tasks and missions on the following year during their service to the company. For the level of Lord, he or she must name his or her replacement for the next Lord if anything happened to him or her during the mission, at least 2 names, he or she also must publish his or her book of laws, regulations, commands and orders, at least 10 pages, should not exceed 100 pages to ease the real process in the execution phase, A4 paper size, at least one flowchart of his or her ideas, at least one clear diagram of instructions, the flow of works, with the assistance of at least 2 of the office workers in the school of engineering, that already study well at least 2 different time zones or at least 2 different kinds of calendar system or at least 2 different kinds of culture or human behaviours, to ease his or her jobs, tasks, missions in the New World. From the at least 4 workers that he or she chose in the development phase, 2 of them will stay close with the company, 1 that he or she chose as his or her replacement and 1 office worker in the school of engineering, while another 2 will follow him or her into the New World, 1 that he or she chose as his or her replacement and 1 office worker in the school of engineering, this is to ensure that the mission in the New World will always stay alive, continuous and ready. The development phase will be at least 12 months inside the company school of engineering, 6 months to learn everything from the office workers who have already reached the level of `true-time master`, and another 6 months is for him or her to develop good and strong state of mind with all the strategies and tactics developed together with the office workers and his or her loyal workers before finally entering the New World with the real aim, to `Command and Conquer`. For every Lord developed by the company for the mission of `breaking new ground`, they will be equipped with at least 2 first-rate ships, in the rating system of the British Royal Navy used to categorise sailing warships, a first-rate was the designation for the largest ships of the line, equivalent to the 'super-dreadnought' of more recent times, a first-rate carried not less than 100 guns and more than 850 crew, and had a measurement (burthen) tonnage of some 2,000 tons, 1 ship will follow him or her into the New World, another ship will be kept with the company in case anything happened to him or her, then another ship will be deployed as soon as possible within 2 months following base 60 system, while always counting that 60 seconds equal to 1 minute, 60 minutes equal to 1 hour to remind him or her that he or she is always `on someone's watch`.

*** For the level of Government, one must have a great desire to become the Rex, there will be no election for this kind of level to assure total allegiance from his workers in his or her group of workers. If anything happened to him or her, immediately, there will be an election from the council of Lords, from the `House of Lords` to elect temporary caretaker elected from one of the Lords of his or her government, he or she will not hold the Rex title, before the real Rex, the real king, finally emerged in the future, the one who can assure total full allegiance without any kind of doubt or hesitation from at least 500,000 workers, to him or her to govern and rule his or her government, the kingdom of his or her own. There will be `House of Lords` in his or her government to ease all the process to govern the Government or Kingdom of his or her own, that will act as his or her main advisors. A Lord will become `Rex` if he or she can finally gain full allegiance, supports from at least 100 Legions or full support and allegiance from at least 100 Lords that commands their Legion, each Legion consist of at least 5,000 workers; 100 x 5,000 = 500,000 workers, at least 3 copy of a letter of authorization and acknowledgement from the Lord of the Legion to acknowledge the power upon the Legion under that Lord's command, one to be kept by the Lord, one to be kept by the Lord that will become the Rex and another copy kept inside the specialized office library inside the company school of engineering.

## 6. Time management.
Before humans know how to hunt, how to tame the animals, how to do the trades, the basis of their survival is to understand the concept of the sun, moon and stars they saw on the sky, to gather all the edible foods around them, try to understand how long it takes to grow back into fruits, invented their own calendar system, invented their own time management system, those who master their time become the master of their life, thus become the masters of survival. There are at least 107 calendars used in this world. In short, time management is very important for the basic survival of a human being, every advanced ancient human civilization on planet Earth was based on an efficient time management system.

Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritising your time. In other words, people who are good at time management are good at getting on and doing things. They are also, however, better at prioritising, and working out what really needs doing—and then discarding the other things.

Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to manage time when accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date. Initially, time management referred to just business or work activities, but eventually, the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any project development as it determines the project completion time and scope. It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of time.

One thing everyone must remember is that **time is limited**, no matter how you slice it, there are only 24 hours in a day. That applies to you, and to your coworker who only seems able to do half the amount of work you do. Whether you rely on a time-chunking technique or discover the power of list-making, you’ll soon find that a nice side benefit of good time management skills is the ability to make better decisions. Through effective time management, you can eliminate the pressure that comes from feeling like you don’t have enough time. You’ll start to feel calmer and in control. When the time comes to examine options and make a decision, instead of rushing through the process, you can take time to carefully consider each option. And when you’re able to do that, you diminish your chances of making a bad decision.

Time management is the key to success. It allows you to take control of your life. As you accomplish more each day, make more sound decisions, and feel more in control, people notice. Leaders in your business will come to you when they need to get things done. And that increased exposure helps put you in line for advancement opportunities. The more you learn about your company and your industry, the better your chances of making a positive impression and raise your standard of living and your position within the company, within the tribe, within the legion, within the government you currently working with in the company.

To make sure time is very important in the company, as a constant reminder, therefore, on every entrance of the company building especially the school of engineering that will be built by the company, there will be installed with an astronomical clock, at the height of at least 33 meters or 108 feet high so it will become visible to everyone entering the school, following the standard of Zimmertoren also known as the Cornelius tower in Belgium, the standard set by Louis Zimmer, an astronomer and clockmaker to the King of Belgium, that consist of the equation of time, the zodiac, the solar cycle and the dominical letter, the week, the globe, the months, the calendar dates, the seasons, the tides, the age of the moon, the phases of the moon, the Metonic cycle and the epact.

Every class in the school of engineering, every room in the library will install both an analogue and digital clock that can count to nanosecond that working in silence, at least at the same level of United States Naval Observatory (USNO) master clock also known as **DOD Master Clock**, The Master Clock is essential for the operation of all kinds of things, including determining your exact position in space, whether you're using a sextant or an application on your smartphone, depends upon knowing the exact time at your location. When you look for yourself on your phone's map, your phone puts the question to a network of GPS satellites up above. The satellites by the U.S. military starting in the 1980s; each is outfitted with its space-hardened atomic clock, which is calibrated every day against the Master Clock. The Master Clock also keeps time for a host of other military operations: flying drones, aiming missiles, establishing secure communications, and other secret things. 

The main office will be located in the centre of the school of engineering, with a direct hit of sunlight from every direction, sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach Earth from the surface of the Sun, a photon starting at the centre of the Sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface, placing a visible horizontal sundial, also called a garden sundial, that stands 35 feet or equivalent to 11 metres above the main office and extends 62 feet or equivalent to 19 metres following the standard of The Whitehurst & Son sundial, every class in the school of engineering will start its every new semester, sēmestris, literally means 'six-monthly' on how to read properly the sun clock, sundial, calendars, analogue and digital clock, with the assistance of the workers that already trained properly by the company, those who already in the level of at least a **Centurion** level of worker, to always remember that `punctuality is the politeness of kings`, to raise them as a proper **Centurion**, **Lord** and **Rex** in the future. Because the main office is located in a location where it can receive a direct hit of sunlight from every direction, therefore it is very suitable to plant any kind of tree there, the Chefs of the school can use all of its surrounding areas including the rooftop of the office to plant the plants that has fibrous roots, which means any small shrubs, vegetables that are edible for humans like pineapple, tomato, cabbage, onion, garlic anything they want or need to fulfil their needs in their kitchen and to socialize more with the office workers in the school building to provide the best-finished product in their kitchen.

The main office of the school of engineering will have its subdivision that will consist a a department to analyze the time management system used around the world, every single year, in a complete cycle 12 months of Gregorian Calendar, sending at least 1 worker who works in the office, for at least 40 days or at least 960 hours, or at least 57,600, or at least 3,456,000‬‬ seconds, or at least 3,456,000‬‬ millliseconds, or at least 3,456,000,000,000 microseconds, following the method, the standard of Mūsā ibn ʿImrān also known as Prophet Moses as mentioned in `7:142`, to become a real time master of the office assigned to him or her, into another country or any culture or any other civilization on the universe that using different kind of calendar system to study on how their time management works, and also to study the behaviour of the company workers time management, to produce a very detail well explained map in every single year for every different timezone and its calendar system that he or she already studied within his service in the office of the school of engineering, his or her yearly works will be archieve properly in the library of the school so others can try to learn from his or works, and try to improve their time management, a specialized division to do research and development on anything related to time management of the workers in the company, and to propose at least 1 solution for the company in every week, every 7 days, on how to improve time management for the workers in the company, with at least 10 special consultation rooms of a size at least 10 feet width x 10 feet length x 10 feet height to try to reach a perfect 10 score, the code of points set by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for the Olympic Games. The term calendar is taken from calendae, the term for the first day of the month in the Roman calendar, related to the verb calare "to call out", referring to the "calling" of the new moon when it was first seen. Latin calendarium meant "account book, register" (as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month). The calends or kalends (Latin: kalendae) is the first day of every month in the Roman calendar. The English word calendar is derived from this word. The Latin term was adopted in Old French as calendier and from there in Middle English as calender by the 13th century (the spelling calendar is early modern). The Romans called the first day of every month the calends, signifying the start of a new lunar phase. A full calendar system has a different calendar date every day. The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be significant for agricultural, civil, religious or social reasons.

After completed the first semester, after the first 6 months in the school of engineering built by the company, the students will be sent to either within the company own farm or any other affiliate farms, at least within The Commonwealth realm that consist of 54 member states with at least 29,958,050 square kilometres of land and sea area territories, for the first time application, to deal with, to do business with The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), commonly called the Foreign Office British Foreign Office, one of a department of the Government of the United Kingdom, where the main office is located in King Charles Street, London, United Kingdom, the whole process can take up to 6 weeks or equivalent to 42 days or equivalent to 1,008 hours or equivalent to 60,480 minutes or equivalent to ‭‪3,628,800‬‬ seconds or equivalent to ‭‪3,628,800,000‬‬ milliseconds or equivalent to 3,628,800,000,000‬‬ microseconds to ensure to make sure the highest security and safety for the students can always be applied during their practical training to master their time management, although the main focus of the school is about civil engineering discipline with government administration studies, they must first master their own time from those who already become the master of the time, from all the successful farmers, successful business farm and estate owners around the entire universe, to gather as much intelligence from the surrounding area, to study well nature, to study the soil and its properties, how to read the surrounding, how to communicate properly with the superiors and the existing co-workers, how to feed an entire nation, to become a well-developed person who always knows how to handle his or her own time, and having a vision on what kind of nation under his or her administration and government he or she wants to look like in his or her future life. Civil engineering is a high-risk business. Neither nature or man is readily predictable and its therefore inevitable that the tasks fulfilling that aim are beset with hazard. The great utilities provided by civil engineering are almost always subject to the limitation of time and budget. They are constructed for impatient clients from imperfect materials and often by less-perfect humans. The profession is frequently at the forefront of knowledge, applying advanced technology to achieve the previously impossible without the benefit of gradual evolution. Mistakes and failures cannot be hidden, and attract subjective public and, or political reaction out of proportion to their consequences, always remember in mind that `an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure`.

## 7. Command & Control and CIA triad.

`It takes a village to raise a child` is an African proverb that means that an entire community of people must interact with children for those children to experience and grow in a safe and healthy environment. A king of a kingdom or a leader of a tribe of a certain community must know how to command, to have or exercise direct authority in order to raise his or her children in their community to be in a safe and healthy environment, those who know how to command or commit is called a **Commander**. Control means the power to influence or direct people's behaviour or the course of events, to exercise restraining or directing influence over, from Anglo-Norman French contreroller ‘keep a copy of a roll of accounts’, from medieval Latin contrarotulare, from contrarotulus ‘copy of a roll’, from contra- ‘against’ + rotulus ‘a roll’, by the meaning of control itself, it means those who want to be in control must know at least the basic understanding of mathematics and accounting knowledge, must know how to read properly, take proper care on whatever that he or she feels important in his or her own possession.

The US Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, a compendium of terminology used by the United States Department of Defense (DOD), defines command and control as `The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission`. A 1988 NATO definition is that command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal. An Australian Defence Force definition, similar to that of NATO, emphasises that Command and Control (C2) is the system empowering designated personnel to exercise lawful authority and direction over assigned forces for the accomplishment of missions and tasks. British Maritime Doctrine (2004) defines `command` as the authority granted to an individual to direct, coordinate and control military forces. Control is the actual process through which the Commander organizes, directs and coordinates the activities of forces allocated to him. US Air Force Doctrine Document says that Command and Control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. It adds that the process of command and control includes the planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling of forces and operations, whereas the system of command and control includes the personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander.

Command is a tool that allows the organization to make a structure.  Then there are functional leaders within that structure.  The pilot is a commander and the functional leader comes from that.  The designated leader is the commander and appointed by authority to make decisions. The functional leader is the leader for the time-specific event. Leadership is not a position; it is a means of influence.  **Command is a position**. A good leader had a clear vision of where they need to go and they inspire others to get there so people will rise to the occasion. If the leader in the command structure does not trust then the command structure breaks down. The command structure allows for effective flow of information. Leaders can over ride the people and goes beyond their training and their ability to obey.

In contrast, `control` is the process used to establish and provide structure in order to deal with uncertainties. Visions normally produce change, which in turn produce tension. These uncertainties cause tensions that leaders must deal with so they do not impede the organization. This is far different from most peoples' conception in which they think of control as controlling others. Command communicates the vision or goal to the best people who can implement it. Throughout the process, it adjusts to new knowledge and refines the vision. Control looks for opportunities to reduce risks, which in turn makes the process more efficient.

In the world of military, a heavily armed, highly organised force, **command places primacy on mission accomplishment**. Definitions of command do not include ‘leading’. Nor do definitions of command mention the influencing of others, which is a vital component of leadership. In this sense, the essence of command is legal authority to order subordinates to pursue assigned tasks.

Command requires organisational structure and obedience from subordinates. Command is a war-fighting enabler, which must be unambiguous, flexible and efficient. Yet, command is not repressive, and it recognises - besides the moral obligations which people owe to `defence` - the moral obligation which individuals owe to themselves. Leadership amplifies command authority. Leaders acknowledge the moral equality of all who serve, and build a climate of mutual respect. In a command position, a leader will not treat people carelessly or off-handedly. Leaders demonstrate consideration and respect for others, which moderates command formality without compromising military effectiveness. Leadership is the core of command success. In positions of command, leaders should personify the ideals of the profession of arms and impress themselves in the consciousness of others as ethical people. Loyalty, trust and dedication are inspired by leadership, not by impersonal command authority. In positions of command and making decisions from a command perspective, leaders trust their judgement, and do the right thing in the right way as they see it. By doing this, leaders meet command responsibilities in good conscience.

Among considerations when applying command and conquer methodology in structuring, organizing to become an efficient company are :
* If you do not know how to administer, your innovation may not be of any use, it may be too idealistic. An innovative idea detached from pragmatism of administration, is likely to turn into chaos rather than a success.
* If you cannot efficiently and effectively maintain something, there is no point in developing it as you will soon lose control over it and may not get the desired benefit. It may actually turn into havoc by developing in undesired directions.
* Becoming people focused is useless if you cannot design and run a good system which channelizes the skills and expertise of your people towards achievement of a common goal. An ineffective system which wastes peoples’ skills soon leads them to demotivation which no amount of people-focus can compensate.
* If you are unable to control and evaluate the activity for which you inspire your people, the failure to achieve desired results will frustrate your people and destroy that inspiration. They will not get inspired for any activity in future.
* If you have the long range perspective but lack the skills required for a short range view of details, the moment you take the first step towards the long range perspective, you are beaten back by immediate hurdles which you did not foresee as you were too busy in setting the long range goals. After all, every step of a ladder counts towards reaching the top of the wall.
* If you do not have the skills of executing and implementing a thing in the right way till its completion, there is no point in determining the right things. Right things will soon go down the drain if not handled in a right and logical manner.

Where poor organizations see and expect different roles from their people, **great organizations demand complete leadership role from every position, at different levels, and expect every manager to act as contributor towards forward movement**. Their managers are not mere administrators, maintainers, controllers, system-oriented and locked to short range perspective, but innovators, developers, people-oriented and far-sighted as well. The result is a complete harmony resulting in a synergetic movement towards great heights. Where poor organizations blame ‘other’ factors for their failure, great organizations succeed on their inner strength.

Australian Department of Defence book on Leadership (2007) says that although the terms of Command, Leadership and Management are closely related, each has a common purpose, which is accomplished in different ways. It adds that `command` does not equate to `leadership` and is wholly different from corporate `management`. It says that `command` is the authority bestowed on an appointment which provides legal authority to achieve a task, and that Leadership and Management are the two means through which the task is completed. It explains that Leadership involves inspiring and motivating people, while management deals with resources and processes necessary to plan organize, direct and control action. It adds that `management` can be actioned without leadership; however, without leadership management becomes routine processes and administration, `management`, of itself, does not motivate. The doctrine concludes that proficiency in all three functions will create success on the battlefield and a poor performance in any of the three functions could lead to failure.

Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the `CIA triad`, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The model is also sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial components of security.

Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy. Measures undertaken to ensure confidentiality are designed to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people, while making sure that the right people can, in fact, get it: Access must be restricted to those authorized to view the information in question. Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data and information over its entire life cycle. Information must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure that information cannot be altered by unauthorized people. Availability is best ensured by rigorously maintaining all hardware, performing hardware repairs immediately when needed and maintaining a correctly functioning operating system environment that is free of software conflicts. It’s also important to keep current with all necessary system upgrades.

To understand how the CIA triad works in practice, consider the example of a bank automated teller machine (ATM), which can offer users access to bank balances and other information. An ATM has tools that cover all three principles of the triad:
* It provides confidentiality by requiring two-factor authentication (both a physical card and a PIN code) before allowing access to data.
* The ATM and bank software enforce data integrity by ensuring that any transfers or withdrawals made via the machine are reflected in the accounting for the user's bank account
* The machine provides availability because it's in a public place and is accessible even when the bank branch is closed.

The best way to ensure that your data, information is available is to keep all your systems up and running, and make sure that they're able to handle expected network loads. This entails keeping hardware up-to-date, monitoring bandwidth usage, and providing failover and disaster recovery capacity if systems go down.

## 8. Sense of belonging & belongingness & belonging.
From a psychological perspective, a **sense of belonging** is a basic human need, with many psychologists discussing this need as being at the level of importance of that as food, water, and shelter. A sense of belonging can be so powerful that it can create both value in life and the ability to learn healthy coping skills when experiencing intensive and painful emotions. The importance of a sense of belonging can be traced back to infancy, where researchers have studied skin-to-skin contact between babies and their parents. What researchers have found is that when this is combined with a strong emotional engagement, a baby's developmental growth and its recognition of self increases significantly.

Sense of belonging in human beings must always be studied well and continuously, different kind of culture, different group of people may have different kind of ideals that can belong to their group. In most part and regions of Asia, it is normal for a human born with black or brown eye colour, but in Finland, the country on planet Earth that has among the highest population with blue eyes colour along with their Baltic states neighbours, some of the Finnish people especially the school children feel left out from the Finnish society, just because their eye colour is different from the rest of the people that currently live in Finland. During World War II, Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party from Germany went very far and extreme to define the sense of belonging to all German people by what they defined as Herrenrasse, the master race, a concept in Nazi ideology in which the putative Nordic or Aryan races, predominant among Germans and other northern European peoples, are deemed the highest in racial hierarchy. Members of this alleged master race were referred to as Herrenmenschen, "master humans", with the traits that can be understandable to European people that defined the North Germanic people especially those live in Sweden and Finland that have the highest percentage of blonde hair and blue eyes colour on planet Earth.

**Belongingness** is the human emotional need to be an accepted member of a group. Whether it is family, friends, co-workers, a religion, or something else, people tend to have an 'inherent' desire to belong and be an important part of something greater than themselves. This implies a relationship that is greater than simple acquaintance or familiarity. The need to belong is the need to give and receive attention to and from others.

**Belonging** is a strong and inevitable feeling that exists in human nature. To belong or not to belong can occur due to choices of one's self, or the choices of others. Not everyone has the same life and interests, hence not everyone belongs to the same thing or person. Without belonging, one cannot identify themselves as clearly, thus having difficulties communicating with and relating to their surroundings.

Abraham Harold Maslow, an American psychologist who was best known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs, suggested that the need to belong was a major source of human motivation. He thought that it was 1 of 5 human needs in his hierarchy of needs, along with physiological needs, safety, self-esteem, and self-actualization. These needs are arranged on a hierarchy and must be satisfied in order. After physiological and safety needs are met an individual can then work on meeting the need to belong and be loved. According to Abraham Harold Maslow, if the first two needs are not met, then an individual cannot completely love someone else.

The need to belong is especially evident in the workplace. Employees want to fit in at work as much as students want to fit in at school. They seek the approval and acceptance of leaders, bosses, and other employees. Charismatic leaders are especially known to show off organizational citizenship behaviours such as helping and compliance if they feel a sense of belongingness with their workgroup. Researchers found that charisma and belongingness increased cooperative behaviour among employees. Charismatic leaders influence followers by bringing awareness to the collective unit and strengthening the feeling of belonging, and that enhances employees’ compliance.

For the workers who already be with the company for at least **pars minuta prima**, already invested first small part of their time in their life with the company, or equivalent to 1 minute or equivalent to ‪60,000‬ milliseconds or equivalent to ‪60,000,000‬ microseconds, but suddenly left the company, maybe for a reason of not feeling a sense of belonging to the company, always value everyone time in their precious lifetime, always remember in my mind in every single of my breath that **punctuality is the politeness of kings**, they will always be part of the family, part of the company. Every time I see a full moon appears on the sky, if they come back to be the workers in the company, there is always a place for them to start over again, they will receive as same as other workers, they must receive at least 1 gantang Negeri of rice, which equals to 2.751 kg of rice following the rules in my mother tongue language "ada padi semua kerja jadi, ada beras semua kerja deras".

EVERY FULL MOON REVISION (AFTER 4 INITIAL YEARS)
---
For the event every leap year on Gregorian Calendar, on every 29 February, which happens only every 4 years on this earth. The workers who are assigned tasks to raise the livestock, especially the cows, will be given 50% share of the ownership of all the calf produced by all the cows (100% owned by the company), so they can feel a sense of belonging to all the cows and calves under their care, to produce more cows and calves for the company in their service to the company. When the worker becomes a leader of a tribe, meaning a leader of 100 workers, he or she will receive another 25% share of the ownership of all the calf produced by all the cows (100% owned by the company). On the first and second year of the worker service to the company, the company will own 100% of all the cows, and the third and fourth year will follow 50%-50% ownership rule to give enough chance and time for cows to reproduce, to make sure all the cows are always enough for every single worker in the company. The workers who already reached a Centurion level and completed his or her service in every 5 years managing the cows and livestock will be transfered into another division to learn a new skill set, abilities to do good trades for the company as a reminder that `life is a journey`.

Normally cows that produced milk for humans often give birth every 400 days or more. They are highly motivated to look for food and forage for 6 to 10 hours a day, grass and concentrates may only provide enough energy for the cows to produce 5,000 litres of milk of production per year. Gestation, the process or period of developing inside the womb between conception and birth, does vary by breed and by sex of the calf, the ranges from 279 to 287 days are normal for the cows that didn't produce milk for humans. For most breeds, 283 days would be common. Cows carrying bull calves, male calves, tend to have a slightly longer gestation compared to cows carrying heifer calves, female calves.

```
Calculation example
---

1 Year = 365 days (according to Gregorian calendar)

First Year : 10 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) 
Second Year : 10 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) 
Third Year : 14 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) + (CHILDREN : 2 males + 2 females)
Fourth Year : 18 cows :: (PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) + (CHILDREN : 4 males + 4 females)

Therefore: 14 cows owned by the company (10 PARENT cows + 4 CHILDREN cows), while another 4 cows (4 CHILDREN cows) fully owned by the workers to create a sense of belonging for their daily works for the company.

[ The worker finally become a leader of his or her tribe, become a Centurion, a leader of 100 men or women ]
Fifth Year
...
(PARENT : 5 males + 5 females) + (CHILDREN : 4 males + 4 females) => (GRANDCHILDREN : 10 males + 10 females)
(PARENT [ ALL COWS 100% owned by the company ] + (CHILDREN : 4 cows owned by the workers, 4 cows owned by the company) + (GRANDCHILDREN : 15 cows owned by the  workers, 5 cows owned by the company)

For the Lords and Rex level of workers, those commanding at least 5,000 men or women under them, for everything they found on land, and sea will be divided equally, 50% will belong to them, while other 50% will belong to the company as a whole to create a sense of belonging to all their works in their territory, their area of interest, except diamonds and platinum group of metals, which they may choose one of the best diamond and platinum metal every single year for them and their men or women under their command, while other diamonds and platinum group of metals found will belong to the company, this is to make all the civil engineering related works easier for everyone, to build proper cities, towns, villages, roads, highways, expressways, bridges, school buildings, to cut the stones, to cut the big trees, to do the mining activities, almost every single civil engineering related works will take a lot longer, longer route, longer path, longer time, more effort if cannot get the best equipment, best tools to do the engineering works.

The name platinum is derived from the Spanish word platina “little silver", the name given to the metal by Spanish settlers in Colombia. The six platinum-group metals are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. They have similar physical and chemical properties, and tend to occur together in the same mineral deposits. However they can be further subdivided into the iridium-group platinum-group elements (IPGEs: Os, Ir, Ru) and the palladium-group platinum-group elements (PPGEs: Rh, Pt, Pd) based on their behaviour in geological systems.

The platinum metals have many useful catalytic properties. They are highly resistant to wear and tarnish, making platinum, in particular, well suited for fine jewellery. Other distinctive properties include resistance to chemical attack, excellent high-temperature characteristics, high mechanical strength, good ductility, and stable electrical properties. Apart from their application in jewellery, platinum metals are also used in anticancer drugs, industries, dentistry, electronics, and vehicle exhaust catalysts (VECs). VECs contain solid platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) and are installed in the exhaust system of vehicles to reduce harmful emissions, such as carbon monoxide (CO), by converting them into less harmful emissions.

Palladium in the platinum-group metals, for example, acts as an excellent catalyst, and helps turn some of the polluting compounds expelled as part of an internal combustion engine into less harmful components. These compounds – such as hydrocarbons and nitrogen – are highly damaging to humans and the environment, and have been subject to strict regulations in recent years.

Currently, the biggest suppliers of the six platinum-group metals, the ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, comes from African regions, Russia and North America. By hook or by crook, must try to learn their language, cultures and interests, also what is happening inside their politics and government administrations, to make all civil engineering related works to flow without any interruption, hire as many people as possible into the company, from all kind of backgrounds to ease all chain of supplies.

*** This also applies when you are working for others, with the company trade partners, the main property, the trees never belong to you, unless that property produces some profit, that tree produces some fruits, then some of it can belong to you when you ask it first from the owner under mutual agreement from both parties, normally humans will share some of their belongings to those who work well, treat them good but in the first place, you must always remember that property, like the trees, or any livestocks belongs to them, not you. Work hard until people fully believe in you, then maybe one day, people acknowledge you.

<a name="unit"></a>
## 9. Unit of measurement.
A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity. Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement. Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.
<br /><br />
The definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of systems of units used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system.
<br /><br />
In trade, weights and measures is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).
<br /><br />
Metrology is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement. In physics and metrology, units are standards for measurement of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. Reproducibility of experimental results is central to the scientific method. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.
<br /><br />
Science, medicine, and engineering often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in problem-solving.

## 10. Commodity.
The word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French commodité, "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin commoditas, meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word commodus (from which English gets other words including commodious and accommodate) meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit". In short, commodity means **_a useful or valuable thing_**.

## 13. Workers registration requirements.

Every worker must at least completed their state government senior year, twelfth grade, year 12 or grade 12, in some country like Norway, the senior year as what most countries called the twelfth grade does not exist as the education system in Norway is only compulsory until 10th grade. As long as the state government published their official certificate of attendance, certificate of completion of the state government secondary education system for the worker who wishes to register into the company. Then, you are eligible to enlist yourself into any missions in the company. That's it, there is no age limit or other requirements, just finish your secondary state government school system to make all the process involving with the state government easier to accomplish your missions, works and jobs with the company. **Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson**, an English business magnate, investor, author and former philanthropist, attended Stowe School, an independent school in Buckinghamshire until the age of sixteen, yet he is the individual brain of Virgin Group and owns more than 400 companies, was tagged as a millionaire by the age of 23. It is not really all about what you know and what industry you are qualified in, it is about how you learn along the way, learning every single day and discovering the answers. At the starting point, an individual, of course, lacks the experience, revenue, and resources. `Consistency is the key, we are what we consistently do, excellence is therefore is not an act but a habit`; a settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up. If you are an orphan, literally or figuratively, cannot finish the senior year of your state government school system, then it is alright, as "orphans make the best recruits", we can work together to solve this matter, consulting about this matter with your current state government as all the training and education system is provided by the company to do all your work when you are working with the company; the instructors, teachers who will guide you are always tested every single week under special company examination, will not exceed 60 minutes or 1 hour every single week, to generate alertness, awareness that the work force, workers under their guidance are super important to ensure mission completion, jobs done for the company, `a general is just as good or just as bad as the troops under his command make him`; you just need to work harder than everyone else who are born 'lucky', `practice makes perfect` and keep on repeating the mantra `I will prepare and some day my chance will come`, `there are no secrets to success, it is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure`, most of successful people on this world really work hard to be successful in their life like **William Henry Gates III**, the founder of Microsoft working at least 16 hours every single day, **Thomas Alva Edison**, an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor, one of The Men Who Built America as described in History Channel documentary, is more extreme, working at least 18 hours every single day to be successful in his life, he said that `none of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.` and `genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration`, people who work in Wall Street know about the value of working hard to be successful in their life, especially those working in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ, the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, has always been known for incredibly hard-driving, hard-working people, working 20 hours a day, that is why New York City where Wall Street are located, gained the nickname **The City that Never Sleeps**, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015 of $1.45 trillion; Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period, it is alright if you don't know this economic term as it will be discussed in great details during the company training period after you master bit by bit in **Statistics and Probability** discipline during the company basic principle in economic classes, you may understand what GDP means when you try to read state government's annual report when you are trying to make a better decision later in your life; produced nearly the same amount of economic output as Canada ($1.55 trillion), the #2 largest country on planet Earth and would have ranked as the world's 11th largest economy as a separate country, ahead of Russia ($1.32 trillion), the #1 largest country on planet Earth, **Elon Reeve Musk**, chief executive officer (CEO), chief technology officer (CTO) and chief designer of SpaceX even said that he `work every waking hour` to be successful in his life. **John Davison Rockefeller Sr.**, an American business magnate and philanthropist, widely considered the wealthiest American of all time, and the richest person in modern history, the first billionaire (in US dollars) in history, with estimation of wealth value in today's dollars, at $318.3 billion, who rise from being a bookkeeper, making 50 cents a day at a produce brokerage firm called Hewitt & Tuttle to making at least $318.3 billion, said about `hardworking culture` to be successful in his life, `the secret of success is to get up early, work late and strike oil.` Not everybody in this world was born lucky like others around them but everything is possible in this world as `for the courageous, nothing is unattainable`, `there is nothing impossible to him who will try`, `where there's a will there's a way`, oὐδὲν τοῖς θαρροῦσιν ἀνάλωτον. Even Rome, where words like genius, engineering come from, where all the roads lead to Rome, was originally founded by the orphans. The religion of Islam was also brought by the prophet who was an orphan. Believe in yourself, don't let others limitations overshadow your talents.

After completing the company training, remember that `the great aim of education is not knowledge but action`, therefore keep on practising all the knowledge gained, again believe in yourself when trying to complete the mission given by the company, `no problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking`, `the more that you read, the more things you will know, the more that you learn, the more places you'll go`, and this is true when dealing with the state governments in this world, to do business, to do trade with the people in that state, the law of state keep on changing based on the situation of that state, mastering law requires discipline and focus. Be organised. Make lists. Scan through the reading material before you start reading, so as to highlight the more important parts. Structure your learning and readings will help you keep the big picture in mind while you’re wading waist-deep through journal article or text book analysis, and deftly lift only the meaningful information from the swamp of legalese. For example, in the state of Texas in the United States of America (USA), the #2 most powerful economic powerhouse of United States of America (USA) after the state of California, under **Texas Family Code § 1.101**, it is assumed that `Every Marriage Presumed Valid`, common law marriage provisions in the state of Texas make a marriage legally valid if both parties agree to marry, live as a married couple, and tell others that they have married. If you publicly announce that the person is your husband or wife three times, your marriage is legal in the eyes of Texas state of government. A few caveats: both parties must be at least 18 years old, unmarried, and not related to each other.

The methodology that will be use in the company training is based on `lean thinking`, a business methodology that aims to provide a new way to think about how to organize human activities to deliver more benefits to society and value to individuals while eliminating waste, based on systems engineering text books; `The Machine That Changed the World`, `Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Organization`, `Seeing the Whole: Mapping the Extended Value Stream`, `Lean Solutions: How Companies and Customers Can Create Value and Wealth Together`, `Lead with Lean: On Lean Leadership and Practice`; this is to give fresh workers enough time, practice, room for try-error-improvements while reducing as many waste as possible, eliminating all the unneccessary non-sense; meaning that things of no importance or value, also means something that is ridiculously impractical or ill-advised; in their works and their life to create values for themselves, himself or herself as individual and to the company as a whole, culminating a pure `hardworking and cleanliness culture`, achieving the basic stage to become a `Scrum Master` as fast as 6 months in training who are `able to clear the obstacles, establishing an environment where the team can be effective`, and the next 3 months with the help and support of the company trade partners, while doing practical training can `ensure a good relationship between the team and product owner also known as initiative owner; in easy comprehensible words is the bosses, the leaders, main person of company trade partners when you are doing your practical training, as he or she usually want to deliver value to his or her customers (including internal customers and future users) and to the business, ruthlessly rank-orders that list according to the latest estimates of value to internal or external customers and to his or her company; one of the reason why 'lean thinking' approach was selected to be able in the first place to create values to yourself and to the company as a whole; as well as others outside the team`, able to `protect the team from outside interruptions and distractions` and able to `address team dynamics; the unconscious, psychological forces that influence the direction of a team’s behaviour and performance` to complete all the basic disciplines and requirements to become a `Scrum Master` equivalent to a level of `Time Master`;before adopting `waterfall methodology` after the company's school of engineering established in the future for better preparation into aerospace, defense, health care, finance, legal industries. Documentation is a must when implementing waterfall methodology to produce the best quality, durability, aims for completeness, getting it right on the first try, not giving even a single failure in each of its phases. It is strictly sequential and top-down, that means it has to be thorough planning in the documentation. It always learns from the previous phase, getting stronger and stronger phase by phase. In 1985, the **United States Department of Defense** captured this approach, the waterfall methodology in DOD-STD-2167A (Department of Defense Standard 2167A), titled `Defense Systems Software Development`, was a United States defense standard, published on 29 February 1988, which updated the less well-known DOD-STD-2167 published 4 June 1985. This document established `uniform requirements for the software development that are applicable throughout the system life cycle`. One of the reasons why the federal government of the United States, the national government of the United States of America (USA) through The United States Congress, the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States and consists of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate; approved Lockheed Martin Corporation project called `Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II`, although it cost more than $1.5 trillion United States dollar: $406.5 billion for acquisition plus $1.1 trillion for operations and maintenance. 1,000,000,000,000, in example one million million, or ten to the twelfth power is defined on the short scale. This is now the meaning in both American and British English. $1.5 trillion United States dollar meaning $1,500,000,000,000. The project was later taken by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, a major unit of Lockheed Martin Corporation with headquarters at Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a cornerstone of the aerospace and defense industry in Texas, United States of America (USA), the multirole 5th generation stealth fighter so far is responsible for more than 254,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs.

`Focus is generally defined as a ‘state or quality of clarity.’ Attention is generally defined as ‘awareness.’`
Time is free, but it’s priceless. You can’t own it, but you can use it. You can’t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you’ve lost it, you can never get it back. You may delay, but time will not. Lost time is never found again. The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it. We all have twenty-four hour days. Everyone’s time is limited. Success is a mystery but death is certain, `mors certa, hora incerta`, death is certain, its hour is uncertain. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time. What matters most is to focus on what matters most. 

`Do not many of us who fail to achieve big things fail because we lack concentration – the art of concentrating the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else?` - **John Davison Rockefeller Sr.**, an American business genius, he never had a year where he didn’t make a profit, flourishing even in recessions, who embodied the ideal of the self-made man, stabilized a volatile industry, created jobs, brought down the price of oil (it dropped 80% during the life of Standard Oil), and became history’s greatest philanthropist.

Human attention never ceases for a moment. We are always attentive to something. The focus of our attention is in a constant state of change. This is why it can be said that at any given moment we are where our attention is; where our awareness is. But our attention isn’t always focused; it isn’t always in a state of high quality or clarity. Human focus can be described as both the object of our awareness and the manner in which our attention is given to an object within our awareness. Understanding that focus also describes the manner in which our attention is given to an object within our awareness is a little more difficult. In practising to control or ‘work out’ our attention, we should always keep in mind both the object we want to focus on, and how we focus on the object. Focus is concentrated attention, but our attention has the potential to include many things at the same time. One of good example of explaining about focus and attention is to observe on how **David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)** from Denmark works, he finally only works for 10 hours every single week, as he mentioned in his book, `It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work`, yet managed to give birth to `Ruby on Rails` or Rails, a server-side web application framework while he was still working for Basecamp company, emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern, that become the base framework to develop GitHub, which later on 4 June 2018, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion. The deal closed on 26 October 2018. 1,000,000,000, in example one thousand million, or ten to the ninth power, as defined on the short scale. This is now the meaning in both British and American English. US$7.5 billion meaning US$7,500,000,000. `What you stay focused on will grow`. Luxury; a state of great comfort and elegance, the quality of being graceful and stylish in appearance or manner; is defined by attention to the details, `luxury is in each detail`.

The training for fresh workers may take about 3 years to complete, any fresh worker who is still in the trainee mode can challenge any new law that has been passed by the company. If that person is able to gather 50,000 signatures and with support of at least 100 Centurions; against the law within 100 days, a regional company vote has to be scheduled where voters; meaning the company fresh workers who are still in trainee mode; can decide by a simple majority of the voters whether to accept or reject the law. This is to ensure consistency, availability to the commands in the training mode, while maintaining the tolerance towards all the workers in the company, maintaining the sense of belonging to the company. Also, any fresh worker who is still in trainee mode may seek a decision on an amendment of the company law they want to make to the constitution; a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which the organization is acknowledged to be governed. The signatures of at least 100,000 voters and with support of at least 1,000 Centurions must be collected within 18 months. After a successful signature gathering, the company council may create a counterproposal to the proposed amendment and put it to vote on the same day as the original proposal. Such counter-proposals are usually a compromise between the status quo and the wording of the initiative. Voters will decide in a company vote whether to accept the initiative amendment, the counter-proposal put forward by the company if any, or both. If both are accepted, one has to additionally signal a preference. Initiatives (that are of constitutional level) have to be accepted by a double majority of both the popular votes and a majority of the training region, while counter-proposals may be of legislative level and hence require an only simple majority. The decision process by the company will be based on `reliability engineering`, the sub-discipline of systems engineering, that deals with the prediction, prevention and management of high levels of "lifetime" engineering uncertainty and risks of failure, to ensure `chain of command`; in an organizational structure, “chain of command” refers to a company's hierarchy of reporting relationships, from the bottom to the top of an organization, who must answer to whom, the chain of command not only establishes accountability, it lays out a company's lines of authority and decision-making power, the succession of leaders through which command is exercised and executed; the line of authority and responsibility along which orders are passed within a unit and between different units can work efficiently without any single failure when the workers are working with the company, ensuring the mission, job, task completion for the company. Any fresh worker who dared to challenge the law that has been passed by the company and successfully gathers at least 100,000 signatures and with support of at least 1,000 Centurions, will automatically be offered to lead the company Legion equals to a status of modern Army because already reached over 100,000 men or women under his or her command, influence; under a provision known as "Legion by spilled blood", officially becoming a `Lord Army` when he or she finished his or her 3 years company training.

If you feel the Centurions who is also your teachers, your mentors in the training is too harsh, or you feel him or her is not doing his job, only wasting your valuable time in your training period, or you have any suggestion, comment, or want to donate to the company operation, anything, simply put it into non-transparent `suggestion box` just beside the door, the entrance door, the exit door of training class for easy collection during the cleaning hour, after 7 hours of the company operation hour in every single day. The suggestion box will be using the traditional method, of the size `110 millimetres of width x 250 of length x 400 millimetres of height`, with a hole on top of the suggestion box with dimension `150 millimetres of width x 10 millimetres of length`, since the company will be hiring workers from all backgrounds, including from the very poor class on planet Earth, and expect not everyone has the digital literacy skills yet. Employees at all levels of any organisation have their own unique perspectives and ideas but may not feel comfortable sharing them for various reasons. This is where an anonymous workplace suggestion box comes in very handy. Most of us tend to customize the feedback we share in various social situations to avoid rubbing others the wrong way, especially when we’re not at the top of the social group. Among other reason to have the suggestion box is to have fresh perspectives and ways of thinking by encouraging employees to think of new ideas; empowering employees who don’t feel confident enough to speak openly to still have a say; increasing productivity as employees feel valued and listened to hence having higher morale; cutting expenditure by enabling employees to identify and share ineffective company processes; boosting revenue by enabling employees to identify and share new avenues to generate sales; increasing employee retention levels by giving employees a sense of ownership in the company’s future; fixing conflicts early by offering an accessible platform to share disgruntlement with colleagues; detecting dishonest, illegal activities in the workplace by enabling safe whistleblowing, and; delivering higher customer value by creating a channel for employees to translate and relay the ideas, tips and complaints they receive from customers about the company’s products/services. Whistle-blowing, as a form of organizational dissent, makes a disagreement with a majority or authority policy or view public. Going public may be necessary if internal options for registering dissents, such as one’s supervisor or top management, are involved or are not seen as supportive. Because such an act often involves the reporting of substantial wrongdoing, many whistleblowers will engage in this dissent anonymously in an effort to avoid retaliation for their actions.

A Centurion means he or she is capable of handling 100 men or women under him or her, the training class will not exceed 7 hours every day, everyone has the right to get around 30 minutes every question he or she asks the Centurion. For the first month, 30 days, therefore everyone under the Centurion guidance can only ask at most 3 questions to his or her Centurion. If exceed more than 3 questions, then just put that question on the `suggestion box`, after 7 hours of the training class, the Centurion will take a look of what you just put inside that `suggestion box`, and will try to answer it in the following day, this is to make sure everyone, 100 people in the class will have their chance and opportunity to interact directly, face to face communication with the company Centurion, before better scheduling; method by which work is assigned to resources that complete the work, can be worked out on the next following month, as it is training while working, mostly by assisting current company Centurion works, the one that assigned to you. Maximizing throughput (the total amount of work completed per time unit); minimizing wait time (time from work becoming ready until the first point it begins execution); minimizing latency or response time (time from work becoming ready until it is finished in case of batch activity).

The law and regulations in the training mode will be based on `case law`, the collection of past legal decisions written by company and similar tribunals; the term is derived from the tribunes, magistrates of the Classical Roman Republic, "Tribunal" originally referred to the office of the tribunes, derived from the Roman tribes; a tribus, or tribe, was a division of the Roman people, constituting the voting units of a legislative assembly of the Roman Republic; in the course of deciding cases, in which the law was analyzed using these cases to resolve ambiguities for deciding current cases. These past decisions are called "case law", or precedent. Stare decisis, a Latin phrase meaning “let the decision stand” is the principle by which judges are bound to such past decisions. These judicial interpretations are distinguished from statutory law, which are codes enacted by legislative bodies, and regulatory law, which are established by executive agencies based on statutes. In some jurisdictions, case law can be applied to ongoing adjudication; for example, criminal proceedings or family law.

In common law countries including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the term case law is a near-exact synonym for common law. It is used for judicial decisions of selected appellate courts, courts of the first instance, agency tribunals, and other bodies discharging adjudicatory functions. The Lean thinking approach that will be applied in training will be a `case-by-case basis`, as a different kind of cases will have their own methodology; a body of methods, rules, and postulates employed by discipline, a particular procedure or set of procedures, to achieve its best efficiency.

Among the reasons why there is a need to have laws and regulations are;
1. Laws protect individual rights and liberties.
2. Laws provide a framework and rules to help resolve disputes between individuals. 
3. Without laws, there would be no way to set standards.
4. Laws help societies to maintain order. 

Before the `House of Lords` fully established; House of Lords must have at least 10 Lords in it to pass the company law, then the law of the company training will be based on the decision of the `School of Centurions` that will consist of at least 100 Centurions in it, a Lord's voice opinion is equivalent to 50 Centurions in the School of Centurions, for the Lord that has already sent to lead any nation in this world, to solve humans main problems in their life especially in food and drinks supply, healthcare system, civil engineering related works, to engineer and develop an efficient system for that nation and also to recruit more workers into the company; his or her voice or opinion is equivalent to 100 Centurions voices in passing the new law for the company. When the House of Lords is fully established then they will be the main body of laws and regulations for the company. School of Centurions and House of Lords will have their own parliament to discuss, to draft new laws and regulations for the company, as the name suggests, "parliament", meaning "to talk", therefore they, the members of the parliament, can talk anything they want in the parliament without any restrictions, `no strings attached`, with full security and protection from any kind of threats, that may coming from outside of the parliament, it will be a "closed parliament" or "closed-door meeting", they can speak openly and honestly about their problem or situation, knowing that everyone else in the room may have experienced similar situations, each of parliament session will not exceed 7 hours in every meeting to solve the problem and to pass the new laws and regulations. There will be at least a `Minute Taker` who is in charge of taking the minutes of the meeting in the parliament session, these minutes are required to provide a formal account of who was at the meeting, what was discussed, what actions were agreed upon, and who would carry out these actions, the `Minute Taker` is in charge of providing the single official version of events. He or she, the `Minute Taker` will work alongside the `Speaker of the Parliament` to make sure that all the important notes, the speeches from the parliament members are taken down in crystal clear, non-confusing statements, or the Speaker, the one with the loudest ever voice that can roar like a real lion; a lion roar can be heard from as far away as five miles equivalent to around 8 km of distance, since a real lion sleeps at least 20 hours before he roaring and go hunting in real life, therefore both the Speaker and Minute Taker will be given at least one day off, at least 24 hours day off, to get full, enough, uninterrupted rest when there is a real need to do a company parliament session; in the parliament will interrupt any speech by the parliament members to remind him or her, that he or she must make a clear clarification of his or her statements. The company worker who successfully achieved the `level of Rex`, meaning he or she is capable of handling of at least 500,000 company workers under his or her command will not be affected to any laws and regulations passed by the House of Lords and School of Centurions, implementing `laissez-faire` style of management for the Rex, a French term that translates as "leave alone"(literally, "let you do"), and in every 2 years, the Rex level of company worker must send at least 1 Lord under his or her command for the company grand presentation focusing on the complex logistics operation, solving other major issues like `Peter Principle`; an observation that the tendency in most organizational hierarchies, such as that of a corporation, is for every employee to rise in the hierarchy through promotion until they reach a level of respective incompetence. Revise the skill training for workers receiving a promotion, and to ensure the training is appropriate for the position to which they have been promoted.

When the `House of Lords` fully established, meaning the official parliament for the company can be fully established; House of Lords must have at least 10 Lords in it to pass the company law, every single member of the company parliament, every single `Lord` in it, will receive at least €6,335 per month; the euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union, the euro is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world, as of December 2019, with more than €1.3 trillion in circulation, the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world, over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro, western countries seem to have the value of their currency more under control, the term `under control` means below, but close to 2% to prepare for the risk of hyperinflation; the term to describe rapid, excessive, and out-of-control general price increases in an economy; according to the European Central Bank (ECB) that believes this percentage is desirable for a steadily growing economy; and entitled to a 30-day leave (holiday) during each of company calendar year, their official residence, is fully paid by the company. Every decision, the law passed within the parliament aim to "promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples", referring to the company workers as their people.

For the **Lord** who was given yearly tasks, job, trade mission inside North America region; Antigua and Barbuda (Caribbean), Bahamas (Caribbean), Barbados (Caribbean), Belize (Central America), Canada, Costa Rica (Central America), Cuba (Caribbean), Dominica (Caribbean), Dominican Republic (Caribbean), El Salvador (Central America), Grenada, Guatemala (Central America), Haiti (Caribbean), Honduras (Central America), Jamaica (Caribbean), Mexico, Nicaragua (Central America), Panama (Central America), Saint Kitts and Nevis (Caribbean), Saint Lucia (Caribbean), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (Caribbean), Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean), United States of America; he or she will be given at least US$2,400,000 per annum to complete the tasks, job, trade mission. The United States dollar is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792. One dollar is divided into 100 cents (symbol: ¢), or into 1000 mills for accounting and taxation purposes (symbol: ₥). The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the dime, nickel, and penny coins, as well as the dollar, half dollar, and quarter-dollar coins, all of which are still minted in 2020. The U.S. dollar as a currency is sometimes referred to as the greenback by foreign exchange traders and the financial press in other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. The Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities. All the United States dollar in form of paper money and coins given by the company must only be used for the company mission for the North America region, to assist the works and administration of the state governments and the people living inside North America region. One of the main reason why the only superpower nation is from this region, the North America region, in this current world is because the North American people, either they are from United States of America (USA) or Canada or Mexico, any parts inside the North America region are super hardworking workers, that is also why they are always seeking all kind of source of energy from all parts of the planet Earth to do their daily works, from oil, gas, nuclear or at least from a cup of coffee that has caffein, that can acts as a psychoactive stimulant drug, to at least activate the signal inside their brain to absorb the energy from their own bones. Canada country for example formed after the explorer John Rae from Scotland try to learn and understand the culture and working habit of the local Inuit people, a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska (United States of America), he travelled at least 10,549.25 km on the icy surface and 10,782.6 km on a small boat for 10 years; in North America, they use small boat like canoe and kayak; There are many types of kayak, most are extremely lightweight and manoeuvrable, yet differing from one another in a number of details. In fact, each Inuit group in North America (with the exception of those living inland, or where the sea is rarely open), seems to have had a distinctive kind of kayak which was carefully built to meet local conditions of hunting, sea, and land or ice portaging. As a result, some types are far more seaworthy than others, and the weight of the hull varies, even within a basic design. Usually kayaks are long (varying between 3 metres and 9 metres), narrow (38 cm to 82 cm across), and low (17 cm to 39 cm). A canoe is a lightweight narrow vessel, typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel and using a single-bladed paddle. In British English, the term "canoe" can also refer to a kayak, while canoes are then called Canadian or open canoes to distinguish them from kayaks. The canoe in North America is called either umiak, umialak, umiaq, umiac, oomiac, oomiak, ongiuk, or anyak, is a type of open skin boat, used by both Yupik and Inuit, and was originally found in all coastal areas from Siberia to Greenland, first arising in Thule times; Thule or proto-Inuit were the ancestors of all modern Inuit. They developed in coastal Alaska by the year 1000 and expanded eastwards across Canada, reaching Greenland by the 13th century; it has traditionally been used in summer to move people and possessions to seasonal hunting grounds and for hunting whales and walrus. Then 20 years after that, on 10 October 1864, all the 32 delegations formed The Canadian Confederation, then after the official declaration **The British North America Act 1867** or known as **The Constitution Act 1867** on 28 Marc 1867, the country now known as Canada is finally officially formed on 1 July 1867, as the #2 largest country on planet Earth. In the case of Mexico, once formed an empire known as Aztec Empire, they originally called themself as Mexica, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the people living there, the country now known as Mexico, the Spanish people called them as `Mexicano`, in English speaking world as `Hispanic` people, the United States of America government used "Hispanic" term in the 1970 Census to refer to "a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race", in the case of Mexico, they speak Spanish language, adopting the idealogy of Spain; **the first true global superpower nation on planet Earth** before it shifts into United States of America (USA); but they, the people who are currently living in Mexico right now are still the true original people of America land even before the Spanish people came into their land to change the way of their life, the way of their thinking, the way on how they speak, the way they govern their land; managed to build a marvel of engineering in hydraulic system for at least 1,200 km on Tehuacán and Oaxaca, whenever the terrible drought occurs in Mexico for 6 months, the hydraulic system will raise by itself to form what is known as 'tecoatl' or 'stone snake' to water all Mexican plants along its way for at least 15 km from its main course. An official statement published by `The International Labour Organization (ILO)`, a United Nations agency whose mandate is to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, published an official statement that the workers in United States of America (USA) work longest hours among industrialized countries, very well known in entrepreneurial spirit, 35% of the population in the early 1900s owned pickup trucks to carry heavy loads for their daily activities, and it is still among the main culture of the Americans, the people inside United States of America (USA) to own and drive their beloved trucks in their daily life to do their daily business; The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration states that the average person inside United States of America (USA) drives around 13,500 miles equivalent to 21,726 km every year. It equates to well over 1,000 miles every month. The average American man drives 16,550 miles equivalent to 26,634 km a year compared to the average woman's 10,142 miles equivalent to 16,322 km a year, Americans take 1.1 billion trips a day, 4 for every person in the United States of America (USA), 45% of their daily trip is to go shopping and doing business; while the people working inside the cities, working 20 hours every single day chasing their life dream, their life mission. Based on the data produced by `Centers for Disease Control and Prevention`, a United States federal agency, under the `Department of Health and Human Services`, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America (USA) published its official statement that on average, American male weights about 88kg, while the female weights about 75kg, on average, an untrained American male at around the average weight of normal American people can lift a weight of least 68kg for a deadlift discipline; the deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground, it is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press; meaning in just a single breath, a normal untrained American male can lift a weight of 68kg, an untrained normal American female can lift a weight of at least 33kg in deadlift discipline, but the properly trained American female, that has a very strong mindset to be on par, on the same level with their male American friends abilities, can even lift a weight of 123kg in deadlift discipline, meaning in just a single breath, a properly trained American female is able to lift a weight of 123kg, the Russian that has a very long history of rivalries with America, try to challenge United States of America (USA) status as a superpower nation on almost every single thing, in the case of Russian strongman called **Ivan Savkin** from Vladivostok, Russia trained like the Scottish explorer John Rae who explored the northern part of American continent that right now known as Canada, #2 biggest country on planet Earth; by **walking at least 15 kilometers every single day**, doing regular basic exercises like squats with a barbell and deadlift, being sure to work out all his muscle groups; finally in year 2019, he managed to demonstrate his ability in the public eyes that he is able to pull 12,400 ton ship, just using his own body strength, that is pulling a weight of 11,249,091 kg, and holds the current **World Record**. So far, the Americans acknowledged the African race origin people to be as same, as on par with their level of super hardworking culture when they elected **Barack Hussein Obama II** to serve as the 44th president of the United States of America from 2009 to 2017, he started his career before elected to be the President of The United States of America by scooping the ice-cream for the Baskin-Robbins company in in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America (USA), to learn about responsibility and hard working culture of the American people. For the non natural-born citizen of the United States of America (USA) like in the case of **Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger** from Austria, in order to match the level and status of super hardworking culture of the Americans, he trained hard since the age of 10 years old, once said `The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich`, aimed to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia. His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day. Finally, after winning 4x Mr. Universe competition and 7x Mr. Olympia competition, successfully published his own success story book with the title, `Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder` in year 1977, then on 17 September 1983, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In year 2003, what he said earlier, his original goal in his life became true, successfully became the 38th Governor of California, the #1 richest and wealthiest state in United States of America (USA) from 17 November 2003 to 3 January 2011. `All blame is a waste of time. No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much you blame him, it will not change you. You may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming him, but you won't succeed in changing whatever it is about you when the others are working so hard to be on the level and status they are currently sitting on right now.`

Although in training mode, as a human, may need to work 20 hours or more to be on top of the productivity; the quality, state, or fact of being able to generate, create, enhance, or bring forth goods and services; while the `apex pradator`, lion in the wild sleep at least 20 hours to be on top of the food chain; In ecology, a food chain is a series of organisms that eat one another so that energy and nutrients flow from one to the next; But one must remember that `until the lion learns how to write, every story will glorify the hunter`. Therefore keep on practising become a good writer and good hunter. **Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson**, the billionaire chair of the Virgin Group and has overseen approximately 500 companies started his career in the business world by learning on how to write well, properly for his magazine called **Student** on 1 January 1968, 10 years later, on 1 January 1978, he purchased his own land, the Necker Island on the Caribbean Sea. The current United Kingdom Prime Minister, **Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson**, also started his career as a writer, working for The Times in 1987, a daily newspaper published in London, one of Britain’s oldest and most influential newspapers, unfortunately, he was fired for not writing well, properly the articles for The Times, then he began working as a writer again, to learn how to write well, properly for The Daily Telegraph, where he served as a correspondent covering the European Community. In 1994, Boris Johnson became a political columnist for The Spectator, and in 1999 he was named the magazine’s editor, continuing in that role until 2005. His writing of articles appealed to the newspaper's conservative, middle-class, middle-aged "Middle England" readership, and was known for their distinctive literary style, replete with old-fashioned words and phrases and for regularly referring to the readership as "my friends", on 23 July 2019, Boris Johnson was elected as Leader of the Conservative Party and the next day, on 24 July 2019, the day following Johnson's election as Conservative Party leader, **Queen Elizabeth II** appointed Boris Johnson as the Prime Minister of United Kingdom. **Steven Paul Jobs** also known as **Steve Jobs**, an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor, the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT., for example, started his journey by trying to become a good writer in the disciplines of `calligraphy`; from Greek, καλλιγραφία, a visual art related to writing, it is the design and execution of lettering with a broad-tipped instrument, brush, or other writing instruments; by learning about the art of calligraphy from Robert Palladino; `typography`; comes from the Greek roots τύπος, typos = "impression" and -γραφία, -graphia = "writing"; and `typeface`; the design of lettering that can include variations, such as extra bold, bold, regular, light, italic, condensed, extended; each of these variations of the typeface is a font. On 19 August 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making Apple the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion. 1,000,000,000,000, in example one million million, or ten to the twelfth power is defined on the short scale. This is now the meaning in both American and British English. $2 trillion United States dollar meaning $2,000,000,000,000.

To achieve at least 500,000 workers in the company, a group of 10 workers in training mode, in 3 years, just need to pass the benchmark of recruiting 10 new fresh workers for the company, in the end, it will be around 3,628,800 workers in the company if everyone consistently recruiting at least 10 workers in the company. When every single workers in the company already reaching the level of `Centurion`, able to recruit at least 100 workers to be under his or her command, in theory the total of company workers will be around 93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Planet Earth currently only has 7,808,646,848 humans, space mission to recruit more workers into the company will be launch in every 1,000 years to recruit more workers from another planet when all the humans on the planet Earth already become the workers for the company. Everything is possible in this world, on average, currently, humans on planet Earth are expanding their population of at least 4.3 births per second or about 256 births per minute.

Trading companies are businesses working with different kinds of products which are sold for consumer, business, or government purposes. Trading companies buy a specialized range of products, maintain a stock or a shop, and deliver products to customers. Different kinds of practical conditions make for many kinds of business. Usually, two kinds of businesses are defined in trading. Importers or wholesalers maintain a stock and deliver products to shops or large end customers. They work in a large geographical area, while their customers, the shops, work in smaller areas and often in just a small neighbourhood. Trade word comes from Middle English trade (“path, course of conduct”), introduced into English by Hanseatic merchants, from Middle Low German trade (“track, course”), from Old Saxon trada (“spoor, track”), from Proto-Germanic *tradō (“track, way”), and cognate with Old English tredan (“to tread”). Traffic word comes From Middle French trafique (“traffic”), from Italian traffico (“traffic”) from trafficare (“to carry on trade”). The word traffic originally meant "trade" (as it still does) and comes from the Old Italian verb trafficare and noun traffico. Arabic tafriq 'distribution', and Arabic taraffaqa, which can mean 'seek profit'. Traffic laws are the laws which govern traffic and regulate vehicles, while rules of the road are both the laws and the informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic. Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way, and traffic control at intersections. In the religion of Islam, a Muslim must say in their daily prayer to Allah, at least 5 times per day the word `ihdinaṣ-ṣirāṭal-mustaqīm` that means `guide us to the straight path[1:6]`, which also means easy to follow, understandable, non-confusing trade, traffic, path, course, track, way, tread, distribution, road, lane. Every trade must offer `peace of mind`; a mental state of calmness or tranquillity, freedom from worry and anxiety, if something gives you peace of mind, it stops you from worrying about a particular problem or difficulty; and `ease of mind`; a state of `comfort`, avoiding any state, quality of lacking unpleasantness particularly: freedom from pain, hardship, annoyance, idleness, sloth, worry and concern; `peace`; freedom from difficulty, effort, `leisure`, `rest`, freedom from financial effort, worry; `affluence`, freedom from embarrassment, awkwardness; `grace`.

Company training motto is **INSAF**, "**I** come i**N**, I **S**erve, **A**nd I **F**inish, accomplish my mission". Stay focused on your mission, remain steadfast in your pursuit of excellence, and always do the right thing. Nothing is truly impossible in this world, everything is possible because death always continuously says that it is always possible, it is always certain. Words without power; the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behaviour of others or the course of events; is merely philosophy. Always hire all kind of workers all around the world, every single moment of your breath, while you are still alive on this world, then the power will eventually come into inside all of your bones, your nerves, your inner soul, making your vision, the picture; an impression of something formed from a description; clearer from time to time. Sky is not the limit, all things are possible to those who believe. Always hire, never retire. `Every champion was once a contender that refused to give up`.

For the first 6 months, all you need to do is just to practice to be punctual on every single thing, every single work and task given and to obey completely to your Centurions, as the first 6 months is just to train to be the `Time Master` and nothing else, the first thing to learn to be a real `Time Master` is to `obey your Master`, in this case, the Centurions, just ignore all other hierarchy, ranks in the company for the first 6 months to ease all the tasks, jobs, given in the first 6 months. This is to avoid confusion in commands, to adhere completely to the practice in the `chain of command` in its initial phase, the hierarchical line of authority and responsibility in which one rank obeys the one above it. After the practical training with the company trade partners of at least another 3 months, then there will be an advance `Statistics and Probability` classes to discuss in more great detail about `statistical classification`, the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class. Classification is an example of pattern recognition, especially in the sub-topic known as `confusion matrix`, also known as an `error matrix`, a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix). The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes (in example commonly mislabeling one as another). The proper statistical analysis needs at least 30 samples from the real world to give the more accurate result of prediction, that is why you just need do all the tasks, jobs, works, and try to complete it first before you can properly adapt the best-practice methods, since every job, work may have different kind of efficiency based on its cases, obstacles and dependencies. The aim for another semester, another 6 months of company training is to be `Well Rounded Commander`, meaning he or she will not give confusing commands to others, easy to understand, easy to follow when he or she is already on the second stage of the company training.

For the second semester of company training, another 6 months, the first month of it will have a `decimation` procedure, where on each of 10 groups, one of the worst performance workers on each group will form one large group consisting of 20 workers, together with the whole group with the worst performance that will lead by the best overall performance of the original 100 workers, this 20 workers group will temporarily take over by the school officer who is also the real company time master with various time zones to trace the actual problem with their time management and advise all the workers in the group to gain back their time before sending them back to the school Centurions, while during that one month, another 80 workers will form 10 contubernia that consist of 8 men or women each led by a `Decanu`, a leader of 8, that will discuss together with their Centurions, a special topic of `tooth-to-tail ratio`. The tooth-to-tail ratio (T3R), in military jargon, is the amount of military personnel it takes to supply and support ("tail") each combat soldier ("tooth"). While both "tooth" and "tail" soldiers may find themselves in combat or other life-threatening situations, "tooth" soldiers are those whose primary function is to neutralize the enemy. The ratio is not a specific measure but rather a general indication of an army's actual military might in relation to the resources it devotes to supply, upkeep, and logistics. In simple terms, it is ` how many men are required to support one fighting soldier`, in this case, the workers in their group. For the next phase of their at least 3 months practical training with company trade partners, they will form a `battalion` that will consist of at least 300 workers, combine forces with other Centurion group of workers, that will be lead by one company **General Manager**; the general manager is responsible for effective planning, delegating, coordinating, staffing, organizing, and decision making to attain desirable profit making results for an organization. In many cases, the general manager of a business is given a different formal title or titles. Most corporate managers holding the titles of the chief executive officer (CEO) or president, for example, are the general managers of their respective businesses. More rarely, the chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), or chief marketing officer (CMO) will act as the general manager of the business. Depending on the company, individuals with the title managing director, regional vice president, country manager, product manager, branch manager, or segment manager may also have general management responsibilities. In large companies, many vice presidents will have the title of general manager when they have the full set of responsibility for the function in that particular area of the business and are often titled vice president and general manager. In technology companies, general managers are often given the title of product manager. In consumer products companies, general managers are often given the title brand manager or category manager. In professional services firms, the general manager may hold titles such as managing partner, senior partner, or managing director.

After successfully learned all the essential basics in trade, economics, tactics, formations, communication, logistics and management, then you will be welcome into the world of civil engineering as an apprentice on the third semester, another 6 months, signing yourself as a **Legion**, meaning working with at least other 4,999 workers in the company, skilling up your skills especially in masonry and other civil engineering related knowledge and practices to be a part of the next level of workers, to form a **Division**, a group of workers of at least 25,000 workers, that having their specialised tools, equipment, formations to assist a **Corpus**, a group of workers of at least 50,000 workers. In easily comprehensible words, a **Corpus** means the main body or mass of a structure, while the **Division** is the parts that make the body to be well functioning as a whole, a set of proposals or terms offered or agreed as a whole, a **Corpus** will have many specialised **Division** to make it work well as a whole. By the end of the company training, you will form as a strong, nonchalant **Grande Armée**, work well together with at least other 499,999 workers in the company. The **Grande Armée** was known for its innovative formations, tactics, logistics, and communications, most soldiers, in this perspective, you as a worker, can climb the ranks regardless of class, wealth, or national origin.

Until you reach the level of a **Legion**, every single thing of your equipment, tools, apparels will be white colour or easily see to human eyes colours, for easier to see, easier to reach, easier to trace any weaknesses, easier to maintain, at least visible to human eyes from a distance of 2 meters. Until you reached the level of **Legion**, any operation is strictly regional for easier maintenance in any worst-case scenarios. The `stealth mode`, will only be applied when you reached the level of **Legion**, the company Lord or anyone from the House of Lords will take over the company training, conducting the company training together with anyone chosen from the School of Centurions, to form a whole complete body, a **Corpus** for company international mission. The complete whole body, a **Corpus** will work together with other **Corpus** to form a **Grande Armée**, to be well prepared for any company international operations. The level of a **Battalion** means that you are always ready or in Latin, `Semper Paratus`, when you reached the level of a **Legion**, then it means you are always ready in `Any Mission, Any Time, Any Place` when you reached a level of `Division`, it means that you are building proper specialised body parts to form a `Corpus`, a whole complete super body of structure in the future before enlists yourself into **Grande Armée** to fight together with other super body, `Corpus`, in the company, since it takes at least 2 to make a fight, `nisi paria non pugnant`.

A **Legion** will be formed when there are at least 50 Battalions, or 10 Brigades formed from the school of engineering, then from 50 Battalions, or 10 Brigades, that means they are a `battle-ready` group, will then be divided into 3 Legions that each single **Legion** consists of 5,000 workers inside that single Legion group, 5 Legions will form a **Division** that consists of 25,000 workers inside it, 2 Divisions will form a **Corpus** that consists of at least 50,000 workers in it, at least has a **tooth** and a **tail**, that is why you been taught about a special topic of `tooth-to-tail ratio`, before forming a **Battalion**, so you get used the concept tooth-to-tail ratio (T3R) when forming a **Corpus** in the future. 10 Corpus or Corporations will form a **Grande Armée** that consists of at least 500,000 workers in it that are well prepared for any international mission and operation for the company.

Before forming a **Legion**, you will form a **Brigade** as a bridge, a well preparation before becoming a **Legion**, 1 Brigade consists of 3,000 workers, 10 Battalions will become 1 Brigade, commanded by an officer holding the rank of Brigadier, who is referred to as the "Brigade Commander". Before forming a **Brigade**, you will form a **Regiment** consists of 1,500 workers, 5 Battalions will become 1 Regiment, commanded by an officer holding the rank of Colonel, derives from the same root as the word "column", in Italian, "colonna" and means "of a column", and, by implication, "commander of a column". The first use of colonel as a rank in a national army was in the French "National Legions" (Légions nationales) created by King Francis I by his decree of 1534, it also means that he or she is the officer of the crown (corona), his or her title is "Colonel of the Regiment", his or her main duty is to properly check, raise the **morale**, also known as **esprit de corps**,the capacity of a group's members to maintain belief in an institution or goal, particularly in the face of opposition or hardship. Morale is often referenced by authority figures as a generic value judgment of the willpower, obedience, and self-discipline of a group tasked with performing duties assigned by a superior. Morale is important in the military, because it improves unit cohesion; the action or fact of forming a united whole. Without good morale, a force will be more likely to give up or surrender. Morale is usually assessed at a collective, rather than an individual level. Esprit de corps is considered to be an important part of a fighting unit.

**_Training grouping level : [ Person | P-1 ] -> [ Group of Ten | G-10 ] -> [ Battalion | B-300 ] -> [ Regiment | R-1.5K ] -> [ Brigade | B-3K ] -> [ Legion | L-5K ] -> [ Division | D-25K ] -> [ Corpus | C-50K ] -> [ Grande Armée | GA-500K ]_**

The letter “k” was chosen to denote the verbal prefix “kilo”, which originates from some form of the classic Greek word χιλιάς (“thousand”). The initial letter of that letter originally described a strongly aspirated “k” sound and therefore replaced by “ch” in Latin in Greek loanwords. When the metric system was first adopted in France in the 1790’s, the spelling “k” was chosen, since its pronunciation in French is close to the classic pronunciation of the Greek word, while the digraph “ch” denotes a completely different sound in French (corresponding to English “sh”). The “K” is derived from the Ancient Greek khiloi, which means “one thousand.” It was introduced via an irregular French borrowing (kilo-, where it would have been *chili- or chilo-) of khilo.

**_The flow of competency level when the company school of engineering is fully established in the future : [ Time Master ] -> [ Well Rounded Commander ] -> [ Civil Engineering Apprentice ] -> [ Degree of Master Mason ]_**

Masons work in the construction industry. They are typically responsible for the construction of the foundation and walls of buildings and lay the blocks and bricks used for these structures. Masonry work must be highly durable, and masons work with sturdy construction materials, including cement, brick, stone, and concrete block. It can be a physically demanding role with a lot of heavy lifting and manual.

When it comes to building and construction, masons have one of the most important and difficult jobs. They build structures, sometimes enormous buildings, from individual blocks or units. Because masonry usually forms a structure from the base up, it’s vital that each unit be perfectly level and plumb. Going out of level, even the smallest amount, can result in instability for the rest of the structure. So, it’s important that a mason have the right tools on the job site to help ensure that each project they tackle is sound. From plumb bobs to lasers, masons have a variety of tools to choose from, but the one that gets the most use, and is almost always at hand, is the level. A good, accurate level will ensure that each stage of the structure is plumb, level and structurally sound.

For the company worker under the age of 25 years old, there will be no night work for them, this is to make sure they will reach their full potential of maturity in the future, at least 10 hours rest every single day for them, meaning that between 9pm to 7am, they will go into deep rest state, emerging science about brain development suggests that most people don't reach full maturity until the age 25. A special privillege; special right, advantage, immunity, protection and exemption will be granted for the female workers that has children under the age of 25 years old, if there is some uneasiness in her mind about her own children, she will be granted at least 10 hours off-duty for a day but she must tell her superior; someone that is higher in rank, higher in status about her intention so the overall work flow will have some backup plans for it, as it is her own duty to raise their own children. `The energy of the mind is the essence of life.`

Every single day, before night approaches, before 6 pm (post meridiem, on the 12-hour clock), every vehicles and equipment must be clean, must do the daily closing ceremony. In case of emergency, everything should be well and ready. `The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.`

Every 10 years, there will be a financial allocation for involvement in any kind of motorsports and automotive industry, anything that can see it always moves on the normal human eyes, in this world, sending at least 2 workers, to develop better thinking approach to problem solving, especially in building better engineering `waterfall methodology`, building confidence before taking much bigger projects, engineering minded people in motorsports like in the history of Formula One championship generally always found genius way to bend the strict rules set up by The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile to win the championship they are competing in. `Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you are right, either way, you are right. The limit is not the sky, the limit is your mind, you are your only limit`.

First experimental supercomputer launch date : 8 September 2040 during planetary alignment of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the crescent Moon, planets will be close to the horizon as darkness is falling.
