## 3. Benchmarks.
At least go as big as `Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran`(around 500,000 workers), better as big as `Russian Armed Forces` (around 3,000,000 workers), then try to aim the total number of `United States Armed Forces`(almost near to 10,000,000 workers).

There are on average about 250 human babies born every minute, more than 130 million in a year on planet Earth. It is estimated a human female can have around 15 to 30 children in a lifetime, taking pregnancy and recovery time into account. Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia is said to have given birth to 69 children over 27 pregnancies. Augustus II the Strong also known in Saxony as Frederick Augustus I, who was king of 18th century Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania is fathering, a rumored 370 children, Sultan Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, the second ruler of the Alaouite dynasty, popularly known as "Warrior King" in Morocco, is reported to have had at least 1,171 children, and Genghis Khan, Emperor of the Mongol Empire, notorious for conquering large areas of 13th century Asia, which became the largest contiguous empire in history of planet Earth, is estimated to have had between 1,000-2,000 human children. Therefore 500 men can reach into 500,000 humans if they really want it to happen in their life. On planet Earth right now, usually the Arab female like to give birth to more than 10 human babies in their lifetime, in the case of Malaysia country, the father of current 8th Malaysia Prime Minister, Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Dato' Haji Muhyiddin bin Haji Muhammad Yassin father, Tuan Guru Haji Muhammad Yassin bin Muhammad, on average each of his wife gave birth to at least 11 children. Female humans usually having 2 million to 4 million of eggs when they were born, therefore a single female human has a minimum 4x chances to produce more than 500,000 humans on planet Earth.
