Just to make sure in every 10 hours, they will get at least
1) FREE Accomodation ((length : 250 inches) x (width : 250 inches) x (height : 250 inches), per capita)
2) FREE Bath (150 liters, per capita)
3) FREE Drink (2.5 liters, per capita)
4) FREE Bread (1/4 of single dinner plate, per capita) 
5) FREE Meat or Fish : depends on available livestock || Vegetables for Vegetarians (1/4 of single dinner plate, per capita) 
6) FREE Fruits (1/4 of single dinner plate, per capita) 
7) FREE Rice || Buckwheat or Millet for workers that need to chase their time (1/4 of single dinner plate, per capita)
8) FREE Toilet Paper (1 roll : 4.5 inches long x 4.5 inches wide, at least 200 sheets per roll, per capita)
9) FREE Soap (1 US fluid ounce or 29.5735 milliliters, per capita)

13) 1 hour rest after 10 hours work

* a single dinner plate is at least 13 inches in size <br />
* since animals, livestock like cattle, cow, that needs years to multiply, goat, sheep, that needs half of a single year to multiply, it needs a very good management, give it some time to multiply, among the solution is the bird type of meat like chicken also only take couple of months to multiply, and the water-based animals like fish that usually take weeks to multiply <br />
* 1 cup of wild rice need to cook between	45 to 55 minutes before serve it to workers, some workers may need to chase their time for their other tasks or jobs they need to do in their life, therefore should give them other cereal option that can help with the workers time management <br />
* all foods and drinks must be fresh, properly cooked to prevent any sickness of the workers, to maximize the amount of nutrient intakes, maximum is 24 hours from the kitchen finished product preparation to the table of workers, specialize the route for dining preparation so everything can move smoothly, eliminating any waste of time during the food and drinks preparation for the workers
* drink is at least properly boiled raw water, properly treated hot tea, properly treated hot chocolate
* bread is at least a loaf of baguette, a loaf of brioche, a loaf of fougasse, a loaf of michetta
* fruit is at least one cavendish banana, one watermelon, one pineapple, one papaya, one guava

Every night, before 11pm, do a daily check-up on the kitchens and bathrooms, make sure everything is working fine, in good order, in a good arrangement, clean and tidy, without any mess. If everything is strange or broken, take some simple notes of it, try to fix it within 24 hours, the clean working environment creates a clean mind for everyone, easy to reach meaning easier access for everyone.

EVERY 2 DAYS
---
Make sure everyone can get at least 8 hours sleep and rest, do rotation of workers if any of them is not enough of rest. Allocate enough resources for at least 5 subtitute workers for one week of work, in any case of emergencies occurs.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply between the current day and previous day, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain.

EVERY 7 DAYS
---
At least 24 hours enough sleep and rest every single week, continuously without any interruption or any disturbance, having very strong mental health, in a very good state of mind, in every beginning of the month in the Gregorian calendar.

2) FREE Citrus (1 citrus of at least  3 centimetres in diameter, per capita)

* There are at least 110 species of citrus on planet Earth to choose from for the workers, to make sure they are always in a good health every weekend to do their daily works. Every week make sure to check their teeth and tongue, give them at least 1 citrus if found anything strange on their teeth and tongue, and give them rest of at least 24 hours, 1 full day off, to give them enough time for health recovery.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain. Plot a simple weekly graph and do simple statistics about it to read what is happening to it.

EVERY FULL MOON
---
Every time I see a full moon appears on the sky, every single worker must receive at least 1 gantang Negeri of rice, which is equals to 2.751 kg of rice following the rules in my own mother tongue language "ada padi semua kerja jadi, ada beras semua kerja deras", and every leap year on Gregorian Calendar, on every 29 February, which happens only every 4 years on this earth, every century of workers which is equals to 10 contubernium with a total of 80 men commanded by a centurion, a total of 81 workers, must receive at least a 4 year old healthy cow following the standard of Etruscan Emilia-Romagna, which means every cow must be a weight of at least 1,000 kg for each century of workers.

Make sure to count everything is enough for every worker, make use of the unit of measurement and commodity used for the mission, always make calculation on the differences of the supply, take notes of anything happening in the supply chain. Gather all the weekly graph, weekly statistics and make a comparison to better understand what is happening with the workers. Call for a general meeting with the workers who already reached the level of centurion to reorganize the strategy, tactic and plan for all the workers under their command.

Produce a well-crafted hardcover book that consists of at least 25,000 words with the aim on how to hire more than 500,00 workers around the world into the company, priorities for the first 5 years is to Centurions, the commander of at least 100 workers, that are determined to become the leader of a **Legion**, a group of workers that consist of at least 5,000 workers. Try to ease their path to become a **Legion**, give them a guarantee of the future of their children, their family members, their relatives, their friends, anyone they want from the entire universe to be absorbed into their own **Legion**.

Make sure to make a good introduction, a proper table of contents of that book so it can become a good reference, good guidance for myself and the Centurions. Try to gather all the obstacles and challenges from the Centurions, before writing that hardcover book, in the mission to hire more than 500,000 workers around the world. On every page, on every side of that book, make sure to leave a blank space of at least 1 inch equivalent to 2.54 centimetre, so that everybody who read that book can write down their chain of thought, or leave some brief note about the writings of that book, on every new chapter, leave a full blank space of a single page to ease, clear the reader's mind, taking a new fresh breath, take some brief break, before entering a new chapter of that book.

EVERY 25 YEARS

Create own financial, monetary system, unit of measurement to be used by the **Lord**, try to ease their path and the flow to become the **Rex**, commanding at least 500,000 men or women under him or her, to be the real **King** of his or her own **Kin**, for his or her rulership on his or her own home state of government in the next 25 years of service. Currently in the United States of America (USA), a gallon, the US gallon is equivalent to 128 fluid ounces or 3.785 liters (American spelling). But in the United Kingdom (UK), a gallon, an Imperial gallon is equivalent to 160 fluid ounces or 4.546 litres (British spelling). A clear vision, backed by definite plans, gives a tremendous feeling of confidence and personal power. A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Explore new planet to recruit more workers into the company. Tell any creature I found on any planet in the universe, "join the workforce, may the force be with you". Bring all the best fruits from planet Earth produced by human workers that the company recruited in planet Earth.
<br /><br />
The flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, Angiospermae, or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants. They are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; in other words, a fruiting plant. The term comes from the Greek words angeion ("case" or "casing") and sperma ("seed").
<br /><br />
There are at least 7,500 types of apples all across the world, each is different according to their natives, there are at least 1,600 types of bananas alone. Do farming activities on that planet, so there will always be enough fruits, enough food and drink supply for every human and any living creatures on any planet in the Solar System.

## 3. Benchmarks.
At least go as big as `Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran`(around 500,000 workers), better as big as `Russian Armed Forces` (around 3,000,000 workers), then try to aim the total number of `United States Armed Forces`(almost near to 10,000,000 workers).

There are on average about 250 human babies born every minute, more than 130 million in a year on planet Earth. It is estimated a human female can have around 15 to 30 children in a lifetime, taking pregnancy and recovery time into account. Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia is said to have given birth to 69 children over 27 pregnancies. Augustus II the Strong also known in Saxony as Frederick Augustus I, who was king of 18th century Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania is fathering, a rumored 370 children, Sultan Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, the second ruler of the Alaouite dynasty, popularly known as "Warrior King" in Morocco, is reported to have had at least 1,171 children, and Genghis Khan, Emperor of the Mongol Empire, notorious for conquering large areas of 13th century Asia, which became the largest contiguous empire in history of planet Earth, is estimated to have had between 1,000-2,000 human children. Therefore 500 men can reach into 500,000 humans if they really want it to happen in their life. On planet Earth right now, usually the Arab female like to give birth to more than 10 human babies in their lifetime, in the case of Malaysia country, the father of current 8th Malaysia Prime Minister, Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Dato' Haji Muhyiddin bin Haji Muhammad Yassin father, Tuan Guru Haji Muhammad Yassin bin Muhammad, on average, each of his wife gave birth to at least 11 children. Female humans usually having 2 million to 4 million of eggs when they were born, therefore a single female human has a minimum 4x chances to produce more than 500,000 humans on planet Earth.

## 4. Worker flow.
**_LEVEL_** <br />
**[ Fresh Worker ]** --> **[ Centurion ]** --> **[ Lord ]** --> **[ Rex ]**  <br />

**_RATIO_** <br />
**[ 1:1 ]** --> **[ 1:100 ]** --> **[ 1:5,000 ]** --> **[ 1:500,000 ]**  <br />

**_DURATION_** <br />
**[ 0 -> 13 months ]** --> **[ 13 months -> 25 years ]** --> **[ 25 years -> 50 years ]** --> **[ 50 years -> infinity ]**  <br />

**_REALM_**  <br />
**[ Person ]** --> **[ Tribe ]** --> **[ Legion ]** --> **[ Government ]**  <br />

*** Nothing is really impossible in the world of engineering, the word engineer (Latin : ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to create, generate, contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness"). If the worker, he or she really want to rise to be the **Rex**, to rule his or her own kingdom, his or her own government, nothing is really impossible if he or she really believe that he or she can do it in his or her lifetime. <br />

<a name="unit"></a>
## 5. Unit of measurement.
A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity. Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement. Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.
<br /><br />
The definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of systems of units used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system.
<br /><br />
In trade, weights and measures is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).
<br /><br />
Metrology is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement. In physics and metrology, units are standards for measurement of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. Reproducibility of experimental results is central to the scientific method. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.
<br /><br />
Science, medicine, and engineering often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in problem solving.

<a name="commodity"></a>
## 6. Commodity.
The word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French commodité, "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin commoditas, meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word commodus (from which English gets other words including commodious and accommodate) meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit". In short, commodity means **_a useful or valuable thing_**.
